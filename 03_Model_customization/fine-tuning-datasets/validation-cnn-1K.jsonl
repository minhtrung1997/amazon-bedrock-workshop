The moth likely laid hundreds more eggs after the two he left behind on Barnard . Perhaps that sensation he thought was biting was actually the moth laying her eggs.

However, since his move to Brighton in 2013 his stock has soared and, under former boss Oscar Garcia, he was awarded the club’s Young Player of the Year trophy in his first season. It was Garcia who converted him from a centre-back into a defensive midfielder. Under Sami Hyypia he struggled for games but has since been brought back into the fold by current manager Chris Hughton. ‘There is no doubt he has ability,’ Hughton said last month. ‘He is a physical player as well. He can give us something on set plays. Garcia converted from a centre-back into a defensive midfielder under former Brighton boss Oscar Garcia . ‘When you are as big as Rohan you know he has the ability to get on the end of set plays. He also likes to break from midfield. ‘He has an athleticism about him and his past was playing a little bit deeper, so he is always going to be seen as that more defensive type of player. ‘In a team with good footballers it gives him an opportunity to improve his game on the ball. At this moment he has been playing and he'll look to keep developing.’ But Brighton could struggle to keep hold of Ince in the summer with his contract moving into its final year in June. If Liverpool were to win the race to sign him, he would be the third member of the Ince family to play at Anfield after his second cousin Tom Ince and his father Paul.", "completion": "response:\n\nLiverpool, Newcastle, West Ham and West Brom havescouted Rohan Ince .\nHe started as a centre-back but was converted into a defensive midfielder .\nInce started his career at Chelsea before joining Brighton .\nCLICK HERE for all the latest Premier League news ."}

Bathers (left to right) Fanny Caritte,  Milena Georgeault and Maxime Goyou Beauchamps  show off their frozen hair while bathing in a 40C in air temperatures of -30C at Takhini Hot Springs in Whitehorse, Yukon . Milena Georgeault and her friends were this year's victors, thanks to an elaborate freezing of their hair at the hot springs. So long as the temperature goes as low as -30C, the freezing of the hair can happen in under 60 seconds. The competition runs every year in February, and all candidates have to do is enter the springs and freeze their hair. To be in with a chance of winning a $150 prize, people have to post the photo of their frozen hair onto the venue's Facebook before the month is out. Milena Georgeault of Quebec shows off her frozen hair that helped her to first prize in the competition and a $150 prize . By doing so you will also be helping publicise this unique niche of the springs - photos may be used for advertising purposes unless you contact management to say otherwise. All contestants will receive a complimentary pool pass for having participated. The first building development around the hot springs can be dated back to 1907 when a man by the name of Mr Puckett purchased the land at a price of $2,000 per acre.

Most other diving birds are able to simply fly on land - but not the penguin. Now, researchers hope to unravel the mystery of the waddle - and find out how it evolved . Watch the penguins on their custom catwalk . Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. Researchers set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it. The penguins walked over this to get their breakfast . Researchers also filmed the walk in slow motion, and are looking for the forces the birds excert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are. Scientists from the Royal Veterinary College and University of Texas at Austin have visited London Zoo to study the way the animals walk. Prof John Hutchison from the RVC said: 'The upright posture and waddling gait of penguins is not often seen in other birds. 'Most wing-propelled diving birds move using flight when they are not in the water.' Using a special motion detecting 'catwalk' Professor Hutchison and paleobiologist James Proffitt have been measuring how the Humboldt penguins apply forces on the left and right legs as they waddle. 'We're trying to understand the minute detail of how waddling works with living penguins, and then taking that back in time, looking at the fossil record of penguins to understand how evolving for such a specialised underwater lifestyle has affected their ability to move on land,' said Proffitt. 'We set up a corridor with a platform that had force plates embedded in it. If they want to move quickly or cross steep or rocky terrain they may jump with both feet together. 'The penguins walked over this to get their breakfast . 'We were looking for the forces they exert, how it breaks down between each leg and what the biomechanics of that are.'

According to the Dalian Daily, the two men, surnamed Han and Zhang, were sentenced to eight and six years in prison respectively earlier this year. The report said that Han, 30, was approached by a person claiming to be a journalist via the instant messaging app WeChat. The \"reporter\" assigned Han to work in a military base, taking photos of \"sensitive areas\" of a major military project with his phone in the name of news gathering. Last summer, he traveled to Beijing and Liaoning, in China's northeast, to take photos, including images of exhibits at a national defense technology promotion show. He later passed recordings and photos to his \"employer,\" the report said. \"Although the enemies' tricks are cunning, they are totally preventable,\" the paper said. When contacted by CNN, Dalian's Public Security Bureau confirmed the media report was correct but declined to give further details. The other man, Zhang, 23, had sent more than 500 pictures of the Liaoning aircraft carrier, named after the province where it was refitted, to a person who claimed to be an editor with a foreign magazine before being detained last August. Two months earlier, Zhang had quit his original job for this better-paid side job, the paper said. The paper published photographs of their \"spying equipment\" -- iPhones, computers and cables.

U.S. calls to Cuba have typically been put through by companies in other countries like Italy and Spain. But now an agreement has been signed  that allows Americans and Cubans to make direct phone calls. Etecsa, Cuban's state telecommunications company, said the change would make calls easier and more affordable. President Barack Obama, pictured at the National League of Cities Congressional City Conference, declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba. A direct telephone line between the two countries has been re-established for the first time in 15 years . 'It contributes to providing better infrastructure and better communications quality between the people and our two countries,' it said. The move marks a historic shift in U.S policy, which aims to bring an end to half a century of Cold War tensions. The lines were originally cut after American phone companies refused to pay a 10 per cent tax on calls between the two countries. But President Barack Obama declared the end of America's 'outdated approach' to Cuba in December, announcing the re-establishment of diplomatic relations as well as economic and travel ties with the communist island. At the time he said: 'Isolation has not worked. It's time for a new approach. 'We will end an outdated approach that, for decades, has failed to advance our interests.' Around two million Cuban-Americans are thought to live in the U.S. and many families rely on phone calls to stay in touch. Bill Pereira, CEO of Etecsa, said: 'We hope that this is the beginning of something, of a relationship that will allow us to build and grow and facilitate and ease communication between family members and loved ones.' Havana residents use public phones to make calls in December 2000. The Cuban government cut off direct telephone service from the United States to Cuba, although Cubans could still call the U.S. Residents are hoping that the step forward will lead to other services becoming available. Less than a quarter of Cubans, whose average wage is $20 per month, currently have any type of internet service. Virtually all home connections remain illegal and getting online at government centres is very expensive, as they charge between $2.50 and $4.50 an hour. Obama set connectivity as a priority in the United States' new relationship with Cuba, making telecommunications equipment, technology and services among its first priorities.", "completion": "response:\n\nCalls previously had to be put through by companies in other countries .\nChange should make calls easier and more affordable for residents .\nHistoric shift in U.S. policy as Obama declares end to 'outdated approach'"}

She accused the standout driver of grabbing her by the throat and slamming her head against a wall in his motor home at Delaware's Dover International Speedway in September. Twice, the NASCAR 2004 Cup champion appealed his indefinite suspension and lost both times. That meant he missed the season-opening Daytona 500 as well as two subsequent Sprint Cup races. But he should be able to compete through the fall, and NASCAR says that it will waive its requirement for him to compete in all championship events. The case against Busch took a significant turn last week, when the Delaware Department of Justice announced that charges would not be filed against him. \"As I have said from the beginning, I did not commit domestic abuse,\" Busch said then. \"I look forward to being back in racing as soon as possible and moving on with my life.\" A Kent County, Delaware, family court commissioner ruled in February that Busch must stay away from Driscoll for a year. NASCAR officials decided to lift Busch's suspension because he complied with the requirements of the racing circuit's reinstatement program, completed behavioral assessments and got the OK from a behavioral health care expert to race again. He's not totally out of the woods. In a news release, NASCAR said Busch must \"undergo additional steps to address the behavior for which he was penalized.\" Steve O'Donnell, NASCAR executive vice president and chief racing development officer, said the lack of charges against Busch expedited his return. \"We have made it very clear to Kurt Busch our expectations for him moving forward, which includes participation in a treatment program and full compliance with all judicial requirements as a result of his off-track behavior,\" O'Donnell said. CNN's Jill Martin contributed to this report.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe lack of charges against Busch expedited the decision, a NASCAR official says .\nKurt Busch was accused of grabbing his ex-girlfriend by the throat, slamming her head .\nHe twice appealed NASCAR's indefinite suspension and lost ."}

The livestreaming app was the \"SXSW sweetheart\" this year, despite having only launched on February 27. It's been adding users rapidly ever since -- even Jimmy Fallon is streaming his life using Meerkat. As part of CNN's Instant Startups series, CNNMoney correspondent Laurie Segall reached out to Meerkat's Ben Rubin with some questions. And he agreed to answer them -- on Meerkat, of course. You can see a few moments from the chat in the video above. Rubin is actually the co-founder and chief executive of Life On Air Inc., a livestreaming company with many tentacles. But recently Rubin decided to dedicate his entire team to work on Meerkat after the app's popularity exploded. Still, Rubin said, he doesn't consider the app an \"instant startup\" per se. It took years of work to reach this moment, he said. The half-hour chat between Rubin and Segall was informative and entertaining. Several people said it broke their record for the longest Meerkat stream they had ever watched. We heard more about Meerkat and Rubin's vision for the future; for example, he sees the app branching out to work with other platforms, like Facebook or Tumblr. Rubin also revealed who he'd like most to join in the fun. Startup wannabes also got some great advice from this successful entrepreneur. Launching a new business or product is difficult, and requires flexibility, Rubin said. Entrepreneurs need people they can trust -- who won't be afraid to call \"b.s.\" on a bad idea.

Peak blooms are expected at the tail end of the three-week-long National Cherry Blossom Festival, which kicks off Friday and runs through April 12. The fluttering pink and white blossoms are expected to hit their peak between April 11 and April 14. Here are five things to know about the eagerly awaited D.C. blossoms: . The city's first cherry trees were destroyed . In 1910, 2,000 cherry trees arrived in Washington, thanks to a gift from the city of Tokyo and the advocacy of Eliza Ruhamah Scidmore, one of the first female board members of the National Geographic Society. These trees, however, were riddled with disease and were destroyed. Two years later, first lady Helen Herron Taft planted one of the first of more than 3,000 replacement trees sent from Japan. Winter's almost over: See the proof . The festival was launched more than 20 years later . It wasn't until 1935 that civic groups and the D.C. government came together to hold the first \"Cherry Blossom Festival.\" That first official festival came after smaller commemorations including a three-day celebration in 1934 and a 1927 re-enactment of the original planting of the trees by a group of Washington school children. It's not all about cherry trees . That's right, there's a Blossom Kite Festival right in the middle of the cherry blossom festivities on March 28th. The festival consists of a hot tricks showdown, learning how to make and fly kites, and there's even a kite doctor on site to repair broken kites. Two types of trees dominate . In the 1912 gift of trees to Washington, there were 12 different varieties. Today, two varieties are dominant -- Yoshino and Kwanzan. Kwanzan trees are usually found in the East Potomac Park area and produce pink blossoms. The Yoshino, which produce white blossoms, are closer to the northern part of the Tidal Basin near the Washington Monument. Descendants of the original trees live in Japan . In 2011, about 120 trees propagated from D.C.'s surviving 1912 trees were sent back to Japan to preserve the genetic lineage of the symbolic trees. Over the years, cuttings from the original trees have also been returned to Japan for horticultural projects.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe National Cherry Blossom Festival starts March 20 in Washington .\nPeak bloom is expected in mid-April ."}

The 23-year-old Frenchman had been on the peripheries for some time and was loaned to the Addicks in order to gain first-team football; but following injuries to the likes of Jack Wilshere and Mikel Arteta, he was recalled to north London after just five games. Now, granted the chance to fill Arsenal's void between defence and midfield, Coquelin has not looked back and is thriving in his role as the Gunners' enforcer.

Arsenal's next game is against Manchester United in the FA Cup quarter-final at Old Trafford on Monday. The Gunners lifted the trophy last year after defeating Hull City in the final, but know they will have to be at their best to repeat the feat this term. And Coquelin insists that Arsenal have plenty left to play for this season, challenging for the Cup, while also attempting to finish in the Premier League's top four and overturning a 3-1 defect in Europe against Monaco. He said, 'We've got a lot to fight for. We've got a big game in the Champions League and we need to try and turn that one around. Everything is possible in football.'

The Airbus A330's crew first tried landing the plane around 7 a.m. Wednesday (8:30 p.m. ET Tuesday), getting very close to a runway but not touching down, according to passenger Deepak Malhotra. That was followed by an announcement that the aircraft couldn't land due to poor visibility. About 45 minutes later, though, the crew tried again. This time, the Turkish Airlines plane did get on the ground but it didn't stay on the runway, according to airport officials. The aircraft skidded off, screeching to a stop with its nose pitched down. Pictures showed passengers and crew going down evacuation slides and walking through heavy fog. Despite the rough landing, there were no reports of serious injuries, according to a Turkish Airlines spokesman. Still, the incident did manage to knock out air travel in and out of the Tribhuvan International Airport, the only way in for foreigners wanting to explore Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains. That's because part of the now-immobile Airbus A330 was covering a section of the runway. Nepal doesn't have the heavy-duty machinery required to move it, said Ratish Chandra Lal Suman, the head of the mountainous Asian nation's Civil Aviation Authority.  And large cargo planes that could be brought in to help with the job have nowhere to land now. Having them land anywhere else in Nepal isn't an option either. Instead, authorities are exploring possibly flying in needed equipment to India and then driving it over to Nepal. Until then, all international flights into Kathmandu have been called off until further notice. That includes 40 arriving and 40 departing flights canceled Wednesday.

These days, however, there is one big difference – the manager ogling junior staff may well be a she. And instead of harassing their female co-workers, men appear more likely than ever to be the ones being fondled or wolf-whistled at. Power: Judi James claimed women bosses are now more likely than men to flout workplace etiquette - an issue famously portrayed by Demi Moore in the 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure . Experts say the trend is being fuelled by the growing number of women in positions of power – some of whom feel it is ‘payback time’. The issue was famously portrayed in 1994 erotic thriller Disclosure, in which Demi Moore plays a sex-hungry boss who pursues her male colleague, played by Michael Douglas – then sues him for harassment when he turns her down. Yesterday, communication and body language specialist Judi James claimed women bosses are now more likely than men to flout workplace etiquette. She added that the thrill of being in charge affects their behaviour, with some viewing it as revenge for years of sexual inequality in the workplace. Others think nothing of touching a colleague’s bottom, she said, and believe male co-workers should be glad of the attention. Pests: The issue has more recently been shown in the Horrible Bosses films - and is apparently on the increase, according to Miss James, who advised firms on office behaviour . Miss James, who advises firms on office behaviour, added: ‘If I go into a company and someone’s bum’s being mentioned, or pinched, or there’s noises or looks as they walk past, I’d say these days it’s more likely to be a woman boss.’ Horrible Bosses 2 is out on Blu-ray and DVD now.", "completion": "response:\n\nJudi James claims women bosses  more likely to flout workplace etiquette .\nCommunication and body language specialist says some see it as revenge .\nOther female bosses believe the man should be glad of the attention ."}

Another airman survived the crash but was reportedly killed by his captors, and the fate of a suspected sixth airman is unknown, the Observatory said.

An amateur video posted online showed rebels inspecting the wreckage of the helicopter, which had rolled on to its side on a rocky hill. The aircraft's blue undercarriage was partially torn and the nose badly damaged. Photographs posted by activists online showed the same crash site and at least two airmen in rebel custody. The United Nations claims the Syrian air force uses helicopters extensively to drop barrel bombs in indiscriminate attacks on residential areas.

The islands are said to be the ideal location to witness Friday's phenomenon due to its location in the eclipse's path and the low pollution in the area. However, the islands are also home to about 3,000 polar bears - the earth's largest land carnivore, and the area's tourist website cautions they attack without warning. Warning: The islands of Svalbard are said to be the best place on earth to watch Friday's eclipse - but they are also home to about 3,000 polar bears, which are known to attack without warning . British teenager Horatio Chapple, a pupil at Eton College, was killed by a polar bear on Svalbard during a schools trek in 2011. Christin Kristoffersen, mayor of Svalbard's main settlement Longyearbyen, said she expected 1,500 visitors for the eclipse, on top of its 2,500 residents, meaning the numbers on the archipelago had reached a maximum safe limit. 'Safety comes first, even before the eclipse,' she said. 'We need to take care of people. It's terribly cold in March and wehave the challenge with polar bears.' Meanwhile, in Germany experts said the eclipse will be a good test of the country's electricity grid, which relies increasingly on renewable energy. The partial eclipse affecting Germany is expected to cause a sudden drop and then a surge in solar-generated power, which contributed almost 6 percent to Germany's energy mix last year. In Britain, some parts of the country will experience as much as 97 per cent darkness, and outdoor events will be held nationwide as people gather to gaze heavenwards at 8.45am. During the landmark event, the Moon will pass between the Sun and the Earth, casting a deep shadow over the planet's surface in a partial eclipse. Unlike 1999, it will not be a total eclipse over Britain, although that will happen over the North Atlantic and the spectacular event will finish over the North Pole. The next similar eclipse will not take place over Britain until August 2026.", "completion": "response:\n\nPeople visiting Svalbard told to watch out for polar bears during eclipse .\nThe islands are one of the best places to witness the phenomenon .\nBut also home to 3,000 of the predators - which attack without warning .\nEclipse to take place at 8.45am on Friday and will be visible in the UK ."}

That was not to be however, as shortly after midnight his girlfriend, Devon Englot, informed him that she was in labor. And this was a quick delivery, so quick in fact that the two did not make it to the hospital in time and Helm had to step up and deliver his daughter Rylee in the back of his car.

'Devon kept on saying that she had the urge to push,' Helm said. And Helm realized what that meant. 'They said when the baby’s ready, the baby’s ready. She can’t really control much about it. We tried to make it there. She tried to hold her back,' he said. 'They’ve always told us the second one comes quicker, but we didn’t expect it to be that quick.' Mom, dad and big sister are all doing fine now . The couple were a mile away from the Providence Park Hospital in Novi, Michigan, when Helm got in the backseat and delivered their baby.

Five minutes later, they were back on their way to the hospital with their new passenger. 'We got to the ER and they kept assuring us that things were going to be OK after they got a good look at the baby and Devon was feeling good,' said Helm. 'After that things slowly calmed down.

Liverpool were favourites to sign the England Under-21 forward in January with his contract ending this summer, but Brendan Rodgers has competition to bring him to Anfield.

But Burnley would receive about £6million in compensation if Ings joined another club in England, while a move abroad would net the second-bottom  side just £300,000. It would cost £43m for United to make Radamel Falcao's season-long loan from Monaco permanent, and Ings is a cut-price option. The starlet was reluctant to leave Burnley in January but becomes a free agent after May. Manchester City contacted his representatives in February and want to sign Ings to boost their homegrown quota. The  champions bought Wilfried Bony from Swansea City for £25m, rising to £28m, in January but Juventus have shown interest in Stevan Jovetic, while Edin Dzeko could leave for Wolfsburg. The loss of Frank Lampard to New York City and possibly James Milner would leave Manuel Pellegrini short of home talent, and Ings could fill the gap. Louis van Gaal sent chief scout Jim Lawlor to watch Ings play against Liverpool at Anfield on Wednesday .

It's also the home to the spectacular Montaña Mágica Lodge, a luxury hotel in the heart of Patagonia's 300,000-acre Huilo Huilo Biological Reserve. Looking as though it's been plucked straight out of a fairy tale, the hotel is completely made out of wood and stone, and would no doubt be at home as a background set for The Hobbit. Scroll down for video . In the middle of the Chilean Patagonian rainforest is the Montaña Mágica Lodge, a luxury hotel built inside of a man-made volcano . Located under the majestic Andes Mountain range, the unique hotel is right in the middle of one of the most valued - and endangered - regions in the world. Aside from simply relaxing inside the one of a kind hotel, venturing into the rainforest offers guests the opportunity to spot many unique animals, such as the Pudu Deer, which is the world's smallest at just 13 inches tall. Inside, the five-floor hotel boasts an all-natural decor in its 13 small rooms, as well as several hot tubs carved out of gigantic tree trunks, and an intimate bar and restaurant area. But to experience the 'erupting' hotel, guests will need to brave a swinging rope bridge to enter, as it is only accessible by foot. The inside bar and restaurant is just as beautiful as the exterior, with it's all-natural wood and stone decor . If you're lucky, you may even spot the adorable 13-inch Pudu deer - the world's smallest - which lives on the nature reserve .

As females fight for equality on all terms, stars like Emma Watson have encountered awkward situations at the end of a meal when they insist on paying their way. But others, like Atomic Kitten's Natasha Hamilton say that a man SHOULD look after a woman - in her new blog for Babycentre, the singer explains why Emma's stance on male chivalry is wrong. Natasha Hamilton with her boyfriend Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive . Natasha, who is currently dating Ritchie Neville from the boy band 5ive, said: 'What is wrong with a man displaying good old fashioned ‘chivalry’ and feeling uncomfortable that she wants to pay? 'This is not a weakness on either side, it’s about letting a man be a considerate, generous, kind human being. Why emasculate him? It’s unnecessary. 'This just puts more pressure on women.' Natasha goes on to point out that the pay gap between women and women is still huge in most of the western world, so through no fault of their own,females bring home much less money than their male counterparts. She said: 'I recently took part in the TV show The Big Reunion, which was a great success. 'But the following year all the female acts got dropped from the tour and all the male acts had yet another opportunity to bring home the bacon.' Actress Emma Watson recently revealed that she tried to pay for the bill at the end of a date and it made the man feel very awkward . Natasha continued: 'There are so many expectations placed on women now. 'If shows like Ex-On-the-Beach are anything to go by, its common place for lads to think they can “bang” as many “birds” as they want, like we’re pieces of meat. 'This is the cultural shift that is openly part of the youth today. 'On top of this, now it’s being suggested girls “pick up their own tab”. Well, it just gets rosier for men doesn’t it?' Natasha Hamilton (left) with her Atomic Kitten band mates Jenny Frost (centre) and Liz McClarnon (right) in 2003 . In fact, Natasha believes that in the 21st Century, it is crucial that men be taught to look after the fairer sex. She said: 'I personally think that men should look after women. That is not a weakness. 'By allowing them to do that, it may create more empathy and stop some men viewing women as “bangable” pieces of meat. 'I fully expect my three boys to be respectful, kind and generous to their future partners too.'", "completion": "response:\n\nEmma Watson tried to pay for meal on date and it made the mood awkward .\nNatasha Hamilton criticises the actress for 'emasculating' the man .\nShe believes men looking after women should not be seen as a weakness ."}

This is the seventh fatal shooting in the area since Michael Brown was gunned down by Ferguson cop Darren Wilson sparking national unrest, reports The St. Louis Post-Dispatch. Police say the shooting happened when an officer pulled a car over at the corner of Morton and Page avenues at 10:15 a.m. Thomas Allen Jr. 34, was shot while driving this car as a police officer 'in fear for his life' was taken along for a ride after a routine stop . While the driver was being questioned, another passenger - Thomas Allen Jr. of St. Louis - is reported to have climbed into the driver's seat and tried to drive off. The officer got into the car and tried fighting with Allen and, 'in fear for his life,' shot the man three times. Fox 2 Now reports one of those shots struck Allen in the neck. The car then jumped a curb coming to a stop behind a home. Allen was transported to a hospital in critical condition - he later died. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is investigating the shooting . The officer was also taken to the hospital for treatment. The Crimes Against Persons Unit is now investigating the incident. The shooting comes just as the Justice Department is set to release a report accusing police in Ferguson, Missouri, of racist behavior that fueled tensions in the city for years before Michael Brown was shot dead. Officers ticketed black citizens above all others in regular traffic stops that were used to boost the department's coffers, senior officials connected to the report told The New York Times. Those unable to pay the fines would be jailed, creating a perpetual and 'avoidable' cycle that ghettoized the African-American community. A racist joke circulated via email among police officers will also be featured in the report to emphasize an overarching attitude that had a 'disparate impact' on black people, it is claimed. Meanwhile, in Los Angeles, officer are under fire for shooting a homeless man dead on the sidewalk in broad daylight. In a video posted online, four officers are seen standing over the victim, who was sat among sleeping bags and tents in Skid Row, downtown LA.

There have been times over the last 12 months, particularly at the World Cup, when I wondered whether we had seen the best of him but what he did against Manchester City was magnificent proof that he is still the best around. What he did to City — and the way he has played since Christmas — makes me think he has jumped back above Cristiano Ronaldo in their struggle to be football’s No 1. It will make their battle in this weekend’s Clasico even more intriguing. Lionel Messi was in inspired form against Manchester City and proved he is still the best around . Cristiano Ronaldo has struggled of late and Messi may have jumped back above the Real Madrid star . I am hoping that the Champions League will produce the dream final of Barcelona versus Bayern Munich — I will be in Berlin on June 6 — and it would be fascinating to see Messi in this form in a showdown against his mentor. We all saw Pep Guardiola’s reaction to Messi’s trickery during the game and, afterwards in Barcelona, I was among a group from Sky that went for some dinner when we were fortunate to bump into Bayern’s manager. He gave us a couple of moments of his time and, inevitably, Guardiola was asked whether he fancied coming up against Messi when the quarter-final draw was made. Bayern, after all, have been in outstanding form, scoring goals for fun, but his reaction was telling. ‘No! No! No!’ said Guardiola. ‘If I have to face Messi, I want it to be in one game rather than two!’ If they do happen to face each other in Berlin — and after Friday's draw it is not wrong to expect Barcelona and Bayern Munich to reach the semi-finals at least — we could safely say we will be in for a rare treat.

But could the ornate splendor of the UK's Houses of Parliament be about to offer a solution to London's housing crisis? In all honesty, probably not. However, that hasn't stopped housing campaign group, Generation Rent, from proposing to transform the Palace of Westminster into affordable new homes. The group's eye-catching idea is to move the seat of British democracy from one of London's most exclusive neighborhoods to a new location in the city of Hull, northern England. The vacant House of Commons and House of Lords (the UK's upper legislative chamber) left behind would be converted into 364 flats of varying size and scale with prime office space facing the River Thames. According to a press release on the proposal from Generation Rent, 335 MPs from all over the UK currently rent second homes so they can carry out their parliamentary duties more effectively. They claim expenses for doing so cost the taxpayer £5.26 million ($8 million) in 2013 alone. By moving the seat of government to Hull, a city with the cheapest housing rent in England, millions could be saved in expenses as well as staffing costs, the group claims. Westminster is one of the most expensive boroughs for property in London, according to research from house moving firm, Delivery Quote Compare. The ever-rising cost of property in the UK capital, meanwhile, is making it increasingly difficult for many to buy or rent in central areas of the city. A January report from rental referencing company, Homelet, also found that average rental prices in Greater London were more than double that of those found in the rest of the UK . \"We hope our proposal gives MPs a sense of humility and some urgency to ending the housing crisis,\" said director of Generation Rent, Alex Hilton. Yet even if the Generation Rent proposals were seriously considered, they could come unstuck by the dilapidated state of the parliament building itself. Speaker of the House, John Bercow, said Monday that repairs needed to bring the nineteenth century structure up to scratch could come close to £3 billion ($4.6 billion). A 2012 study entitled \"The Restorations and Renewal of the Palace of Westminster\" found that the building could suffer permanent damage if work was not undertaken to stem leaks, repair crumbling stonework and remove asbestos.", "completion": "response:\n\nUK campaign group proposes to transform Houses of Parliament into affordable housing units .\nWestminster is one of the most expensive boroughs of London for buying or renting property .\nParliament could require restoration work totaling $4.6 billion ."}

That's why the Australian-born pop star is in Austin, Texas, this week, where he will be performing at a United Nations/MixRadio brunch at the SXSW festival. Simpson, 18, is the spokesman for the #HappySoundsLike playlist, promoting the U.N.'s International Day of Happiness on Friday, March 20. The singer and other celebs selected tracks for the playlist. \"There is honestly nothing I can think of that I like to do more than make other people happy through live music,\" said Simpson, who will perform a few acoustic tracks at the SXSW brunch. The International Day of Happiness is a global celebration that came about after the U.N. General Assembly adopted a resolution in 2011 recognizing happiness as a \"fundamental human goal.\" The observation was decreed in 2012 after the first  U.N. conference on happiness, and the first Day of Happiness was held on March 20, 2013. Simpson said it makes sense to have music as such an important part of the day. \"I want to be able to share a message of happiness,\" the singer said. \"I think music is such an escape for people.\" He selected Bob Marley's \"Three Little Birds\" for the playlist. Britney Spears selected Prince's \"Kiss,\" and Pharrell picked Talking Heads' \"This Must Be the Place.\" Ed Sheeran, David Guetta, Charlize Theron, John Legend and James Blunt are also among those taking part. Simpson recently released a cover of Marley's \"No Woman No Cry\" and said the legendary reggae artist is a personal inspiration. \"The majority of music today has no substance,\" said Simpson, who is an independent artist. \"You want to be able to feel something true.\" As for what makes Simpson the happiest (other than music, of course), he said it's the simple things like relaxing with his family and just slowing down. \"Happiness is kind of taken from you if your mind is too busy,\" he said. \"Be present in that moment.\" Fans are being encouraged to post the song that makes them the happiest using the social media hashtag #HappySoundsLike.", "completion": "response:\n\nSimpson helped curate the playlist to celebrate the UN's International Day of Happiness .\nHe will mark the day by performing at the SXSW festival .\nFans are encouraged to share the songs that make them happy ."}

On nightshifts at his police station, Superintendent Paul Clements is used to dealing with the usual collection of drunks and other ne’er do wells. But he was surprised when three Romanian children arrived at the central London police station at 3am and said they were 130 miles from home. The children, aged 12, 14 and 17, told officers they lived with their parents in Nottingham and then asked for a taxi home and a meal from McDonalds. Instead, officers bought the youngsters sandwiches from a nearby petrol station and called social services to care for them. They also called the children’s parents who immediately travelled from the family home in Nottingham to pick them up. It remains unclear how the children managed to travel to London or how they were able to leave their home without their parents noticing. Details of the visitors to Bishopsgate police station, near Liverpool Street Station, emerged when Mr Clements described the incident on Twitter yesterday. He wrote: ‘Bizarre night shift. 3am and in walk three Romanian children from Nottingham with no money or ID asking for a taxi back home and a McDonalds.’ The children were found roaming the streets in the early hours by officers of City of London Police.

Despite MPs painting a damning picture of the BBC – which they said had blown billions of pounds of licence fee payers’ money trying to be ‘all things to all people’ – Lord Hall was optimistic.

But he also warned that the BBC risks ‘sleepwalking into decay’ unless it reinvents itself for the internet age by collecting users’ data. Lord Hall said the Corporation is in danger of becoming ‘irrelevant’ if it does not gather information about viewers to tailor its services, in a similar way to Amazon and Netflix.

Officials said Tribhuvan International would reopen at 10 a.m. local time Saturday as preparations to move the plane continue. \"We do not know now if it will take longer than then to move the plane,\" Purna Chudal, manager of the Civil Aviation Authority of Nepal, told CNN. More then 160 flights have been canceled since Wednesday's incident, leaving more than 24,000 passengers stranded as officials struggle to remove the immobile Airbus A330 off the runway, Chudal said. The timing of the incident is problematic for Nepal's tourism industry, which is gearing up for the 2015 climbing season. Foreigners heading to Mount Everest and other nearby peaks in the Himalayan Mountains transit through the airport. The authority initially said it would reopen the airport at 10 a.m. Friday, later revising that to 5 p.m., but workers were unable to remove the aircraft by that time. They were able to lift the plane's nose -- originally pitched down -- and change its tires. The main challenge now is to push the grass-grounded plane back onto the runway. Officials say the area under the plane needs to be firmed up -- a process that involves digging into the ground and filling it with gravel -- before push back can commence. The Turkish Airways incident didn't result in any major injuries but the plane has remained aground as Nepal doesn't have the necessary equipment to move it. Cargo planes were unable to fly in heavy-duty machinery because there was nowhere to land. A specialized aircraft carrying experts and aircraft removal equipment from India reportedly arrived on Thursday. Tribhuvan airport is usually closed between midnight and 6 a.m. but will remain open for 24 hours for the next few days until the backlog is cleared. More than 12,000 people fly in and out of the airport daily. The facility services about 80 international flights per day. Domestic service -- operated by by 18 and 40-seater jets -- was not disrupted.

The revelations will come as a huge blow to the former French president, 60, who is aiming for re-election in two years. Adviser Patrick Buisson, 65, was credited with steering Mr Sarkozy into the Elysee Palace, where he served between 2007 and 2012. Nicolas Sarkozy's (left) most senior aide Patrick Buisson (right) regularly mocked him, it has been claimed . But a book called The Bad Genie claims Mr Buisson frequently mocked the 5ft 5in politician, who wore stacked heels, especially when with his third wife, former supermodel Carla Bruni. Mr Buisson, who is an expert on opinion polls, said Mr Sarkozy could 'do nothing without me' and would call him all the time. 'It was the Dwarf' or 'the Little One', Mr Buisson would tell colleagues after receiving a call from Mr Sarkozy. Mr Buisson was viewed as a 'compass' and 'genius' by Mr Sarkozy, despite also being referred to as a 'nutter' or 'airhead'. Sarkozy wore stacked heels, especially in the presence of his third wife, supermodel Carla Bruni . Mr Buisson would not think twice about slamming the phone down on Mr Sarkozy, saying: 'I'm having lunch, you're bothering me'. He would also put Mr Sarkozy's voice on speaker, and laugh about him with friends, saying: 'He can do nothing without me, Naboleon'. The nickname was a cross between 'Napoleon' - the legendary French leader - and the term 'nabot', which means dwarfish. Authors Ariane Chemin and Vanessa Schneider, who both write for Le Monde, said Sarkozy would phone Mr Buisson for 'reassurance' more than his wives. Mr Buisson fell out with Mr Sarkozy last year, after it emerged that he had recorded many of their conversations without the politician's consent. In one, Carla Bruni dubs her husband a 'kept man', thanks to her fortune amassed during her time as a model in the 1990s. Mr Sarkozy went on to sue his former mentor for around 70,000 pounds, saying: 'In my life I've known betrayal, but rarely one like this.' Mr Sarkozy was defeated by Francois Hollande, his detested Socialist rival, in 2012 after just one term in office. The conservative leader of the UMP Party is determined to get back into power, but is facing a range of corruption enquiries. They include claims that he received millions in back handers from former Libyan dictator Colonel Gaddafi.

You're supposed to do a video, of course, and challenge others to do the same for a good cause. The ball got rolling almost two weeks ago on Comedy Central's \"Night of Too Many Stars,\" a fundraiser for autism programs. A tweet from sportscaster Fred Katz challenged the \"Today\" show's Willie Geist and Uzo Aduba, who plays  Suzanne \"Crazy Eyes\" Warren on \"Orange Is the New Black,\" to share a \"Lady and the Tramp\" licorice. It took off from there.  Next thing you knew, Geist was repeating the stunt with Meredith Vieira and the #TwizzlerChallenge was on. Geist and Vieira challenged Matt Lauer and Kathy Lee Gifford.  They were good sports about it, but you may want to close your eyes here.  This isn't for the faint of heart. The challenge is starting to invade social media.  Just search the hashtag #TwizzlerChallenge. It sounds like a sweet deal for the folks at Twizzlers.  Their candy is on the lips of America. And to their credit, a couple of Twizzlers executives took the challenge and donated $10,000. The money goes to New York Collaborates for Autism.  The group funds and creates schools, programs and services for people with autism nationwide. Since 2006, \"Night of Too Many Stars\" has raised over $22 million.

The Home Secretary regularly appears at the top of polls of party members of their favourite politician. But Mrs May is also better liked than the London Mayor among those candidates on a ‘Future MPs Panel’, according to the survey conducted by Populus. Leading the charge: Theresa May (left) is a more likely Tory leader than Boris Johnson (right) a poll of future MPs has found . It found one in four of those questioned thought she would be the next party leader – whether there is a leadership election later this year in the wake of a Tory election defeat or in six years. Some 26 per cent of those asked backed Mrs May, compared to 22 per cent for Mr Johnson, and 12 per cent for Sajid Javid, rising star of the Tory Right, who is Culture Secretary. The poll will disappoint those Tories who want Chancellor George Osborne to succeed Mr Cameron, who did not register as a potential future leader. Mrs May is seen by allies as Britain’s Angela Merkel and is the longest serving home secretary in more than 50 years. She will challenge Mr Johnson – whom she is thought to regard as a ‘faintly ridiculous figure’ – if the Tories lose the election and Mr Cameron stands down. Mr Johnson is expected to return to Parliament as MP for Uxbridge, having been selected as the party’s candidate for the election, while continuing in his role as mayor. Future Labour MPs told Populus that Andy Burnham, the shadow health secretary, was favourite to be the party’s next leader. One in four picked the Merseyside MP and former arch Blairite whose politics have become notably more left wing in recent years. Close behind him was Shadow Business Secretary Chuka Umunna on 22 per cent and Yvette Cooper, shadow home secretary, on 21 per cent.

Ever since the superstar songstress released her surprise self-titled album in December 2013, it seems like dropping music with little to no fanfare has become a thing. The latest artist to do so is rapper Kendrick Lamar, whose eagerly awaited sophomore album was set for release March 23. Instead, \"To Pimp a Butterfly\" was made available on iTunes and Spotify early Monday. Lamar, who has been hailed as the savior of hip-hop, got a major shout-out from fellow artist Taylor Swift. Among the other artists who've surprised fans: . Drake . The rapper thrilled fans in February when he snuck out \"If You're Reading This, It's Too Late.\" Like Beyonce, he clued fans in via an Instagram post. The 17-track project was billed as a mixtape. The rapper also released a short film titled \"Jungle.\" U2 . The shock in the band's album \"Songs of Innocence\" was not only that it was released but that iTunes subscribers had no choice but to get it. Apple made the album part of an automatic download in October as part of the iPhone 6 announcement. U2 frontman Bono later apologized, and Apple distributed info to customers on how they could delete the album after some complained that the automatic download was invasive. David Bowie . In 2013, the legendary rocker unexpectedly released \"The Next Day.\" It was his first new project in a decade, and fans were thrilled, as the famously private Bowie had been off the grid for a while. Wolfmother . The Australian trio received much less attention than some others when they dropped \"New Crown\" in March 2014 with no promotion or marketing. Kid Cudi . The rapper's \"Satellite Flight: The Journey to Mother Moon\" arrived online in March 2014 and led Billboard to ask, \"Is the Beyonce approach working for other 'surprise' albums?\" \"I wonder when this is done frequently, does the surprise factor wane?\" one executive told Billboard. \"If there are a lot of releases promoted this way, it will become less impactful. If mid-level and lower-level artists pile in, will the surprise get applied to the point where the public doesn't care anymore?\"", "completion": "response:\n\nLamar's new album was expected out March 23 but was released Monday instead .\nArtists like Drake, David Bowie have released surprise albums ."}

Larry Coulter told WIVB that he was hauling a load of stones on Monday on the Thruway near Buffalo, New York when one of his tires blew, sending his truck into a guardrail and overturning. The guardrail punctured the fuel tank, igniting a fire that quickly spread threw the truck. With the vehicle's cab on its side, the only door available for Coulter to climb through had been overcome by flames and he quickly realized there was no escape. Scroll down for videos . Terrifying: A burning truck can be seen on the side of the Thruway near Buffalo on Monday. Its driver was saved after a passing motorist threw rocks at the windshield, cracking it and letting him escape . 'The tires were bursting all around me,' he said. 'I just kept thinking it was the end.' He tried to kick out the windshield but the thick smoke made the effort impossible, WIVB reported. Suddenly, a car pulled in front of the truck and its driver, Ed Brunner, jumped out. He attempted to smash the window with a metal bar - but the heat was too much. So instead, he grabbed concrete rocks that had fallen from the truck and started throwing them. To Coulter's disbelief, the man managed to crack the windshield enough for him to kick his way out. 'That guy should have been a professional football player or something,' Coulter said. 'It was just unbelievable.' On footage taken by another passing motorist, Ed Brunner's gray car can be seen, left, in front of the burning truck. The trapped driver, Larry Coulter, thought he was going to die before he saw Brunner approach . Brunner then helped the relieved driver escape. He left the scene before fire crews arrived on the scene and Coulter has not seen his 'guardian angel' since. Coulter, a married father-of-two, was taken to the Erie County Medical Center where he was treated for smoke inhalation. 'He saved my life,' Coulter said of Brunner. 'I owe him eternal gratitude.'

Researchers studied the structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes. These were then integrated by experts at Harvard University in Massachusetts into the elephant genome - and functioned as normal DNA. Scroll down for video . Recreation: Researchers studied the structure of DNA from woolly mammoths (file illustration) preserved in the Arctic to reproduce exact copies of 14 of the extinct animal’s genes . A new method known as 'Crispr' - helping scientists make accurate changes to DNA - was used by genetics professor George Church, who replaced parts of elephant DNA with the mammoth genes. He said: ‘We prioritised genes associated with cold resistance including hairiness, ear size, subcutaneous fat and, especially, haemoglobin (the protein that carries oxygen around the body).’ ‘De-extinction’ enthusiast Mr Church, who was speaking to The Sunday Times science editor Jonathan Leake, added: ‘We now have functioning elephant cells with mammoth DNA in them.’ Mammoths co-existed with early humans who hunted them for food. Comparison: The mammoth was roughly the size as a modern African elephant, standing up to 11ft tall . They are the best studied of all prehistoric animals thanks to the discovery of frozen carcasses, as well as dung and skeletons. The mammoth was roughly the size as a modern African elephant, standing up to 11ft tall and weighing about seven tonnes, and its fur and long hair protected it from severe winters. There are at least three teams trying to rebuild the whole mammoth genome - which could one day become a template to recreate actual mammoths, reported The Sunday Times. But ancient DNA expert Professor Alex Greenwood said: ‘Money would be better spent focusing on conserving what we do have - than spending it on an animal that has been extinct for thousands of years.’ Last week, MailOnline reported how scientists had begun extracting DNA from the remains of a mammoth found in Siberia, taking bone marrow samples from its front left leg. The samples will be examined at a laboratory in Yakutsk, Russia, and by scientists in South Korea - with the hope of one day being able to clone one of the prehistoric animals.", "completion": "response:\n\nScientists study structure of DNA from mammoths preserved in Arctic .\nExact copies of 14 of animal's genes integrated into elephant genome .\nNew method 'Crispr' helps researchers make accurate changes to DNA ."}

Jackson Gordon, an industrial design student from Philadelphia University, constructed the armoured suit with money raised through Kickstarter – a global crowd-funding platform designed to aid creative endeavors. Hoping to raise $1000 to begin the project, Jackson received backing from 17 enthusiasts and raised $1255 – more than enough to begin assembling the suit. Without breaking a sweat: Jackson Gordon holds his hands behind his head as his friend tests the suit with some heavy punches . Made from Kevlar and silicone moulds, the Batsuit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21-year-old from Wayne, Pennsylvania five months to complete from start to finish. Videoed testing the final product with a friend, Jackson  is featured being repeatedly punched in the chest, back and sides while wearing the suit. Despite  Jackson flinching slightly under the impact of the punches, the suit is remarkably durable and the young designer even calls for his friend to hit him harder and with both hands. Made from Kevlar and silicone moulds, the Batsuit is able to withstand the heavy punches that repeatedly rain in . The suit weighs in at just under four stone and took the 21-year-old five months to complete from start to finish . Laughing as the blows rain in, Jackson showcases the strength of the soft plates on the side and shoulder area alongside the harder ones, which also hold up well against the impact. Smiling at the camera in admiration for his suit, The student says: ‘I could do this all day. I can’t even feel it.’ This is the second batsuit created by Jackson, who previously made one based on Christopher Nolan’s Dark Knight Trilogy a year before. The student recently tested his new suit at Maryland’s Katsucon – an annual three day anime convention – in February, where he invited people to assault him, unsuccessfully of course. The video shows Jackson's friend successfully testing the softer plates on the back and shoulder . Stunned: Jackson happily boasts that he could do this all day after claiming that he did not feel a single punch that was thrown at him .", "completion": "response:\n\nJackson Gordon made the suit from Kevlar and silicone moulds .\nSuit weighs just under four stone and took five months to complete .\nThe Philadelphia University student was funded through Kickstarter .\nThe 21-year-old is captured on video taking heavy punches and laughing ."}

University Provost John Etchemendy sent a letter to faculty members highlighting what he called 'troubling allegations' that stem from 'a smattering of concerns from a number of winter courses,' the San Jose Mercury News reported Friday. Etchemendy said the students are cheating themselves and risk severe consequences. All new students are told of the university's honor code and agree to abide by it, he said. Concerns: An unusually high number of students at Stanford University are suspected of cheating during the most recent term (file photo) 'But with the ease of technology and widespread sharing that is now part of a collaborative culture,' he wrote, 'students need to recognize and be reminded that it is dishonest to appropriate the work of others.' University spokeswoman Lisa Lapin declined to discuss details with the newspaper, such as the course or grade level of the students, but she said such concerns are routine. She says that in the 2013-2014 academic year, 83 students violated the honor code. In the most recent term, the newspaper reported that one instructor believes that 20 percent of students in a large introductory course may have cheated. Lapin said that Etchemendy's note underscored the need for faculty members to be clear with their students about expectations at Stanford, which prides itself as being one of the world's leading teaching and research universities. Students accused of cheating have the opportunity to defend themselves against the charge. First-time violators are usually suspended for a quarter and must perform 40 hours of community service, with increasing disciplinary action for subsequent violations. 'We have a lot of classes and a lot of students,' Lapin said. 'It's not unusual to have a handful of concerns raised every term.'

An Indian groom was dumped at the altar after he failed to solve a simple maths problem (file picture) 'The groom's family kept us in the dark about his poor education,' said Mohar Singh, the bride's father. 'Even a first grader can answer this.' Most marriages in India are arranged by the families of the bride and groom. Except for brief meetings, the couple rarely gets to know each other before the nuptials. The incident took place in the village of Rasoolabad village near the industrial town of Kanpur in northern Uttar Pradesh state on Wednesday, local police officer Rakesh Kumar said. The groom's family tried persuading the woman to return, but she refused. She claimed the groom had misled them about his education. The woman's family said that a child could have solved the simple arithmetic (file picture) Local police were called in to mediate between the families and both sides returned all the gifts and jewelry that had been exchanged before the wedding, Kumar said. Last month, another bride in Uttar Pradesh married a wedding guest after her groom-to-be had a seizure and collapsed at the wedding venue. Groom Jugal Kishore was just about to exchange vows when he collapsed with a seizure and was rushed to hospital. Angry that she had not been informed of his condition, the 23-year-old bride, Indira, asked a member of her brother-in-law's family, Harpal Singh, to marry her instead. Mr Singh, who was wearing jeans and a leather jacket, was caught off guard, but agreed to go ahead with the wedding. After the ceremony, Mr Kishore returned to the venue after being treated in hospital to find that his fiancee had married someone else, it was reported by The Times of India.", "completion": "response:\n\nIndian bride walks out of wedding after groom fails basic arithmetic test .\nClaimed that her husband-to-be had mislead her about his education .\nPolice forced to mediate between two families in Rasoolabad, near Kanpur .\nComes after an Indian bride married a wedding guest after her groom collapsed at venue ."}

'We tried to be really persistent in attack but they had a lot of people defending. We tried really hard but we couldn't score.

Although she certainly pokes fun if I get too serious about things. And all that helps,\" Prince Charles told CNN. The couple first visited the U.S. together as newlyweds in 2005, and Camilla was confronted by hardcore Princess Diana fans with abusive placards. Polls at the time found that between 57% and 73% of Brits opposed Charles' new wife being known as queen. If you go back even further, to 1997, the year Diana died, an Ipsos MORI poll put it at 86%. Reporter's notebook: Interviewing the royal couple . But there's been a change in sentiment since they married. A new poll conducted by Comres for CNN found that only 35% now oppose Camilla being known as queen. Nearly one in four said they liked her more now than they did 10 years ago. This coincides with a change in palace strategy -- away from the aggressive spin machine of the 1990s to simply allowing Camilla to be herself. When she appears in public, she's either seen supporting her husband or promoting a set of causes she has a genuine connection with. Prince Charles praised how his wife has handled herself. \"She's done an enormous amount for the whole issue around osteoporosis, which of course runs in her family,\" he said, noting that Camilla's mother and grandmother both suffered from the bone disease. He also points to other issues Camilla is associated with, including literacy and preventing sexual violence. The Duchess of Cornwall, by sticking to what she knows and cares about, is able to connect with the people she meets, which doesn't always come across on camera. When Charles and Camilla married in 2005, there was huge sensitivity around the legacy of Diana, who was expected to be queen herself. With this in mind, royal aides announced that Camilla would not use the title of Queen when Charles becomes King. Instead she would be known as Princess Consort. That still stands, although the public of today looks less likely to oppose the title of Queen.", "completion": "response:\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, preparing for U.S. trip .\nCharles praises Camilla for how she has defined her public role .\nThe two are coming up on their 10-year wedding anniversary ."}

A married mother-of-two broke down in tears after she was told she could be sent to prison for having sex with a 15-year-old schoolboy. Kelly Jane Richards, of South Wales, admitted having sex with the teenager, who is less than half her age. The Jehovah's Witness was arrested last December after the child's mother discovered what had happened. The 36-year-old had originally denied seducing the teen, but pleaded guilty to engaging in sexual activity with a child. Richards sat in the dock at Merthyr Tydfil Crown Court, South Wales, and broke down in tears as the charge was read to her. Two elders from the Jehovah's Witness community were sitting at the back of the court to give her support. The court was told Richards 'did not reasonably believe that he was 16 or over' when she had penetrative sex with the schoolboy just two months before his birthday. The offence took place during term time in 2012, the court heard. A second similar charge was left to 'lie on file'. Sarah Waters, defending, told the court Richards was of 'good character'. Judge Richard Twomlow told Richards she would be sentenced later this month. He added that 'all options remain open' - which includes a custodial sentence. He told her: ' You will be sentenced later this month and I am going to ask for a report so the court knows more about you. 'The fact I am asking for a report and granting bail does not give any indication of the sentence I will pass. 'This is a serious matter. 'Obviously I will reserve the matter to myself and all sentencing options remain open to me.' She was shielded going out of the court by her husband. Richards will be sentenced on March 23.

Vladimir Putin has admitted that he was ready to place his nuclear attack forces on alert when he seized Crimea a year ago. The Russian president's revelation was aired in a pre-recorded TV interview broadcast at the end of last week. In the documentary – titled Crimea: Way Back Home – he claimed the area was Russia's 'historic territory', even though under international law it remains Ukrainian. Putin went on to say: 'Russian people live there, they are in danger and we cannot leave them.' He also claimed that he feared they would have been overrun by 'a nationalist bulldozer' from Kiev, and said he could not have left the area and the people who live there 'to whims of fate'. However the president explained that he knew the West could have intervened, and had been 'ready' to put his nuclear arsenal on alert, adding: 'I talked with colleagues and told them that Crimea is our historic territory. We were ready to do it.' The Kremlin has since claimed it has the right to station nuclear weapons on the Crimean peninsula. Yesterday's interview came a full ten days after Putin was last seen in public, amid rumours of illness, a coup, or his Olympic gymnast 'lover' Alina Kabayeva giving birth to a child in Switzerland. He vanished soon after aides to one of his key allies were blamed for ordering the assassination of one of the Kremlin's most outspoken critics, Boris Nemtsov. Scroll down for video .

Opposition TV channel Dozhd has claimed that the president has hidden himself away in one of his many luxurious official residences, a forest hideaway near Lake Valdai in the Novgorod region. But asked yesterday about whether his disappearance from public life was down to a bout of flu, Putin's press secretary Dmitry Peskov would only say: 'No comment. The topic is closed.' The crisis over his disappearance will deepen if he fails to appear this week at a number of events to commemorate the restoration of Crimea to Russia.

Officers may be better employed tackling current threats than historic crimes and failings, Britain’s top policeman suggested last night. Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe called for a ‘grown up conversation’ about the commitment to investigating decades-old issues. The Scotland Yard boss said he will ‘never shrink’ from the task of bringing a ‘bad person to justice, whoever they are, without fear or favour’. But he added: ‘We have to be better at weighing up the likelihood of success against the risks that those resources might be able to prevent or mitigate in the present day.’ Sir Bernard was speaking in London as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work investigating failings by institutions to protect children. The four-person panel will have statutory powers to compel witnesses and victims will also be able to appear as witnesses. There are concerns that forces are struggling to balance a tidal wave of historic allegations with the danger of present-day criminals. Hundreds of victims came forward in a phenomenon dubbed the ‘Savile-effect’ after the DJ and entertainer was exposed as a predatory paedophile after his death. In his speech, Sir Bernard also said Britain needs fewer pubs and bars in order to tackle the violence linked to binge-drinking culture. He advocated merging many constabularies to create nine super-forces in a bid to cut costs and bureaucracy. Sir Bernard said police need to be more open about how they manage the risks they face, including the £50 million spent on 42,000 missing children every year. And he said the people should protect themselves from crime in the same way people take steps to ensure they remain in good health. ‘I believe that keeping the public safe should be just as high priority as keeping them healthy, he said. ‘I’d like it to achieve the same high profile that prevention has in health over the last 20 years.’ Investigation: Sir Bernard was speaking as a child sex abuse inquiry starts work.

The indictment says she also accepted free medical treatment. No one is contesting that Leigh was at the marathon on April 15, 2013, the day of the attack.

On Wednesday, lawmakers in Ireland rushed to close a loophole that temporarily made it legal to possess Ecstasy, crystal methamphetamine, ketamine, magic mushrooms and a host of other recreational drugs. The loophole was inadvertently opened the day before, when an appeals court invalidated one section of the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977. The court ruled that Irish governments had been unconstitutionally adding substances to Section 2 of the law for decades. \"We prepared for this possibility. Legislation was prepared and approved in advance by Cabinet,\" Minister for Health Leo Varadkar said in a written statement. \"The emergency legislation ... will re-instate the status quo ante and re-control all drugs that were controlled prior to this judgment.\" The emergency law moved through the Irish legislature and was signed by the President on Wednesday, meaning that the drugs would become illegal to possess again at midnight, a Department of Health spokeswoman told CNN. Varadkar said the temporarily legalized substances -- which include a wide array of synthetic or \"head shop\" drugs -- \"all have very significant health risks that outweigh any perceived recreational benefits,\" according to the Irish Times. The original schedule of substances listed in the 1977 law -- including cannabis, cocaine and heroin -- were untouched by the appeals court ruling and remained illegal. Varadkar also told the Irish Times that the court ruling could affect \"dozens\" of cases, although The Journal of Ireland said the court's decision will affect only cases now in the judicial process.", "completion": "response:\n\nThe president signs emergency legislation .\nThe loophole opened when an appeals court struck down part of Ireland's drug law ."}

According to police, the trio had initially targeted a different, younger man walking his dog until they saw Mr Stuhlman, whose dog looked 'weak'. Homicide Captain James Clark said it appeared the shooting occurred on the 6400 block of Woodcrest Avenue after a brief struggle. He told reporters: 'At one point, he did plead for his life. 'He said, 'Please don't shoot me, please don't shoot me,' and they shot still shot him one more time.' Police added Mr Stuhlman regularly walked his dog at night - and often accompanied by his 13-year-old daughter. Brandon Smith (left) and Tyfine Hamilton (right) have been charged with the murder of James Stuhlman in a botched robbery . But on the night in question, he had told his daughter it was late and he would go alone. Officers found him unresponsive at the scene, with the dog's leash still in his hand, NBC Philadephia reported. He was taken to Presbyterian Hospital, where he was pronounced dead. Philadelphia Police Lt. John Walker said: 'The dog was lying next to him -- appeared to be scared and in shock.'

Stewart was in Starved Rock State Park near Utica with a young woman and two 'highly intoxicated' men, according to Illinois Conservation Police Sgt Robert Frazier. The NewsTribune reports that the Aurora teenager hopped a wooden railing and left a walkway before jumping down to the rim of Wildcat Canyon. Injured: Christopher J Stewart (left) slipped and fell 90 feet off Wildcat Canyon and needed to be airlifted to a hospital in Peoria . Once on the canyon's edge, he tried to knock pieces of ice off from the top of the waterfall before slipping and falling 90 feet into the canyon, Frazier said. Utica firefighters responding to the incident carried Stewart out of the canyon on a board before Ottawa River Rescue ferried him across the river to a waiting ambulance. The ambulance then brought the teenager to a Life Flight helicopter to be transported him to a hospital in Peoria. As of Saturday morning, the teenager was reportedly in critical condition though a photo shared by a friend on Facebook show Stewart alert and sitting upright in a neck brace. Remote wilderness: Rescuers had to transport Stewart by boat to a helicopter on a board to transport him to the hospital .

Aftermath: In addition to broken legs, Stewart had multiple fractures (pictured) to his arm along with other injuries that required transportation to a hospital in Peoria . Dangerous drop: Stewart had reportedly jumped a fence and was trying to break ice off the waterfall before he fell, as investigators say a charge of entering a restricted area is pending . Frazier says in addition to the two men, who were both intoxicated and over the age of 21, 19-year-old Kara Watkins from Aurora was charged with marijuana possession of less than 2.5 grams.

On Sunday night we have Gareth Bale, Cristiano Ronaldo and Karim Benzema against Luis Suarez, Neymar and Lionel Messi. Meanwhile our own version of a clasico wil be taking place at Anfield — but no club in the Premier League has a forward line like those in Spain. Increasingly we’re a stepping stone to better things, having lost Bale and Suarez to Spain. What is obvious, however, is that the failure in the Champions League was not a failure of English clubs. It was a failure of clubs with owners from Abu Dhabi, the USA and Russia. In those Champions League games there were five English players in the three starting XIs. Lionel Messi, Luis Suarez and Neymar Jnr will be in action for Barcelona on Sunday night . Cristiano Ronaldo, Gareth Bale and Karim Benzema will be hoping to fire Real Madrid to victory in the Clasico . Fernandinho was signed by Manchester City for £35million from Shakhtar Donetsk in 2013 . Manchester City became the last English team to be knocked out of the Champions League last week . Manchester City's players leave the Nou Camp looking glum after being eliminated by Barcelona . Tottenham's Ryan Mason has enjoyed an impressive season after breaking into the first team . And the managers were from Chile, France and Portugal. The Premier League may be failing but it’s not its Englishness letting it down. So now that even a huge influx of global thinking and talent at both executive and playing level at football clubs has failed, perhaps we can rethink the premise that we need to keep bringing in players and directors from abroad. Of course, there will always be room for the best imports. But you can’t tell me Fernandinho is a better player and better prospect than Ryan Mason. They do a similar job, the only difference being he is a £35million transfer and therefore deemed worthy of a place at a top-four club. It’s time to ensure that some of the proposals from the FA commission, which I sat on, come into place, not least the tightening up of work permits on foreign imports so that only the best from outside the European Union can play here. We’re failing in Europe anyway so the Premier League need to ensure we’re not forever looking overseas for solutions.", "completion": "response:\n\nPremier League clubs not failing in Europe because of their Englishness .\nChelsea, Arsenal and Man City had five English players in their starting XIs .\nFernandinho is not better than Ryan Mason even though he cost £35m ."}

'Typically, in a potential maritime disaster, the best idea is to stay with the boat,' Healey told Fox News. 'But I really didn't feel like getting smashed around like an ice cube in a shaker.' Healey, who is also a free-diver and part-time Hollywood stuntman, sailed over deck and into the sea while his friends held on hard to the railing. After the wave passed, the boat was still standing upright and Healey got picked up by his friends, who he said were 'basically crying laughing at me'.

Jorge Tirado, 43, captured footage of his son riding the waves for the first time on a GoPro camera, and uploaded online. Like a pro: The footage ends with the baby breaking out into a big smile as he rests on the board . The footage shows dad and baby choosing the largest waves, and they even ended up going through the tube in the middle of the wave. Although the youngster does seem nervous when going into the cold water, it soon changes to a smile once the board takes to the waves. Tirado does not specify exactly where the video was shot but tagged it as being in Puerto Rico. Not impressed... Jorge's son looks uncomfortable as they ride into a wave . The baby is visible at the height of a huge wave, bracing himself for impact, with his father propped up over him . The baby looks surprised upon entry into the wave, but handles the impact well . Although there was some criticism over the stunt from online viewers, the dad defended the decision to take his son who he did not name into the water saying: 'My son first try. Thanks to everyone. 'I encourage you to safely bring your kids to the ocean, after all the ocean is the place where it all began. 'By far, this is the best sport for your spiritual, mental and physical health.'

Beginner's nerves: At first the youngster does seem a little nervous when entering the cold water, but he soon learns to love the movement through the water . The baby is then seen in the water, with waves splashing over his face as he is held on the board. At times, the tot doesn't look impressed, as the water cascades over him. But he ends with a smile as he is joined by another surfer. While taking an infant out onto the waves can be dangerous, it is not uncommon for experienced surfers or bodyboarders to introduce their kids to the ocean at a young age.

According to a new survey conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, nearly half of teens questioned (48 per cent) think their parents will help pay for college, but only 16 per cent of their parents reported planning to. Of the 800 parents polled, more than a third said they don’t speak to their children about money at all, stating they want to 'let kids be kids'. Thanks for nothing, dad: The study, conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, found a huge disconnect between parents and teens when it comes to who is expected to fund college . 'It is obvious that parents and teens need to have honest conversations about money management, including paying for college,' said Jack E. Kosakowski, president and chief executive officer of Junior Achievement USA. 'Together as a family, it is important to develop a plan for life after high school – whatever that looks like for your family.' Even when parents do talk to their teens about money, it appears that girls are often side-lined. Around 40 per cent of girls said their parents didn't talk to them enough about finances, compared to just 24 per cent of boys. According to the College Board, the average annual cost of tuition and fees for the 2014–2015 school year was as follows: . Furthermore, females - teens and their parents - both have lower expectations about their potential earning power. Moms are significantly more likely than dads to say their child will earn $15k or less at their first job after graduation (26 per cent compared with 17 per cent respectively). Similarly, when asked about their future earning power, 24 per cent of teen girls say they’ll make $15k or less at their first job, compared to only 16 per cent of boys who feel the same. It appears things aren't improving either. The overall number of teens who think their parents don’t spend enough time talking to them about money matters is up by 11 per cent over last year's findings.", "completion": "response:\n\nA new study, conducted by Junior Achievement USA and The Allstate Foundation, revealed a significant disconnect between expectations .\nMore than a third of parents polled admitted they don't talk to their teens about money at all .\nFemales - parents and teens - both have lower expectations about their potential earning power .\nParents are more likely to discuss money matters with sons than daughters ."}

The college’s board of trustees approved the new policy on Wednesday night. Under the new guidelines, Wellesley College says it will consider for admission any applicant who 'lives as a woman and consistently identifies as a woman.' It adds that if gender identity is not 'clearly reflected' in application materials, the college will request additional information 'that may include a letter from a parent, healthcare provider, teacher, or clergy.' The updated code will come into effect in time for the next admission cycle for the Class of 2020.

A daughter who stole almost £70,000 by collecting her dead mother's pension for  17 years has been spared jail. Patricia Baines failed to inform authorities that her mother Dorothy passed away in August 1986. Officers found £6,000 of the cash hidden in the 62-year-old's shed during a police search, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Baines, of Arnold, Nottinghamshire, was given a 26-week prison sentence, suspended for two years, on Friday after pleading guilty to theft earlier this year. An investigation is now under way to establish where the rest of the money is. Recorder David Chinery said he took account of her personal circumstances and decided not to send her to prison, even though her crime crossed the custody threshold. He said: 'I think you are a vulnerable lady and I am comforted to hear you now have support and are prepared to let people assist you.' Baines stole  £68,211.13 between August 1986 and April 2013, the court heard. Justin Wigoder, prosecuting, said the defendant's father  received the pension under the Nottinghamshire Local Pension Scheme. His wife then claimed a widow's pension until her death, when Baines should have alerted the authorities. Mr Wigoder said Baines abused a position of trust. He said: 'The pension should have ceased.

A spell-binding video documented the epic struggle between some of nature's toughest wildlife - but who will win? The tussle was filmed at the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya, home to hundreds of different species of birds and animals. Clash: A crocodile engages in an epic fight with three lions at the Samburu National Reserve in Kenya . The short film shows an intrepid lions gradually approaching the crocodile, which is resting in shallow water. As the lion gets closer the crocodile opens his jaw, ready to fight. But as it looks like the crocodile is ready to pounce, two more lions rush over to join in the scuffle. All three lunge at the reptile, which thrashes around in a bid to escape the big cats' teeth from sinking into its scales. After a few seconds the crocodile is back on the offensive, despite being outnumbered, sending splashes of water into the air as it faces up to the trio of attackers. Attack: Two lions joined in the fight as one of the big cats starts fighting with the crocodile . Sprint: The pair of big cats gain speed as the crocodile thrashes in the water and opens his jaw at their friend . In the next section of the film, two of them have temporarily moved away to find their next adventure - only to return when they see their big cat comrade squaring up to the crocodile once more. They clash again, this time the bravest of the trio attempting to put his paw on the reptile's head, clearly angering the creature. The trio dive on the crocodile, who thrashes around, jaw wide open, defending itself and its territory. It seems like it's time might be up, as the beasts circle it from all side, one leaping on its tail to pin it down. Take two: The fiesty crocodile bats back the attack from the trio, who fail to make the fatal contact . But the group fail to make the critical, final plunge, hesitating just enough to give the crocodile time for a counter-attack. Instead, it looks like the big cats want to keep their prey alive, so they can play with it some more.

The attackers then burned down the entire village of Njaba, the sources said. Dozens of gunmen invaded the remote northeastern village before dawn Tuesday, singling out boys and girls between the ages of 13 and 19 and killing them alongside their parents, witnesses said. Njaba village lies about 65 kilometers (40 miles) south of Maiduguri, the capital of Borno state. Karimu Lawani, who escaped to Maiduguri after hiding with eight other people behind the barn of a neighbor, said the attackers came into the village at around 5 a.m. \"They shot dead anyone that tried to flee but spared children younger than 13 years old,\" Lawani said. He and other survivors counted the victims of the massacre before leaving the village some hours later. His account was supported by Faltama Bisika, 62, who lost four grandchildren in the attack. \"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee. They particularly targeted teenagers and elderly people,\" Bisika said. News of the attack was slow to emerge due to lack of communication following destruction of cell phone towers in the region in previous Boko Haram attacks. \"I only got information of the attack on my village last night,\" said a civilian vigilante from Njaba who asked not to be named. The vigilante said his father was among those killed. The vigilante said he left Njaba for Maiduguri in June to join others fighting against the Islamist radical group. He said he believes the attackers came from Gwoza -- a town on Nigeria's mountainous border with Cameroon that Boko Haram seized last June -- because Njaba \"lies on the route to Gwoza from Maiduguri.\"", "completion": "response:\n\nYoung victims in the village of Njaba, ages 13 to 19 were singled out for killing, witness says .\n\"They hurled petrol bombs into homes and opened fire on anyone trying to flee,\" witness says ."}

Al Qaeda was demanding a ransom for his release and threatened to kill him if the ransom was not paid. CNN was not able to confirm whether Saudi Arabia or his family paid a ransom in exchange for his release.

Ransoms that are paid to terrorists motivates them to conduct more kidnappings,\" said the official on condition of anonymity because he is not authorized to talk to media .

Two four-wheel drive vehicles were used in the kidnapping attempt, according to eyewitnesses. Their whereabouts remain unknown.

Mr Barnes today called for Gatiss, who has been kept behind bars for his own safety, to feel the full weight of the law. He told ITV's This Morning: 'He needs to go to prison, because otherwise he might just do it to someone else. Somebody else might get something worse done to them than what happened to me.' The frail 67-year-old, who was born with growth problems after his mother contracted German measles while pregnant, said he didn't believe Gatiss's belated apologies. He said: 'It doesn't [make a difference] because it's easy for somebody to say that but still do it to somebody else afterwards, so I'd like the law to take its course.' More than £330,000 was raised to help Mr Barnes after the details of what happened to him travelled around the world. Today, sitting with local beautician Katie Cutler who organised the fund-raising campaign, he said he would be buying a new house. Legal-high addict Richard Gatiss has admitted the cowardly attack and will be sentenced later this week . Mr Barnes said: 'Half of its going on the house and I'll use the rest for living on. It'll keep us going.' Telling of his joy at moving out of the area in which he was attacked, he added: 'As soon as I got to my feet, it was just plastered in my mind that I can't live here any more.' At a hearing earlier this month, Judge Paul Sloan QC told Gatiss he would continue to be remanded in custody and 'an immediate sentence of imprisonment is pretty well inevitable'. It has previously been said in court that Gatiss was trying to get money to buy legal highs when he tried to mug Mr Barnes. Mr Barnes was shoved over and broke his collar bone but Gatiss fled empty-handed when his victim called for help. Mr Barnes revealed he will use half of the £330,000 raised by local beautician Katie Cutler to buy a new home .", "completion": "response:\n\nPartially-sighted 67-year-old was beaten in attack which shocked Britain .\nHis attacker, Richard Gatiss, is due to be sentenced later this week .\nMr Barnes calls for drug addict to be jailed to prevent further crimes .\nHe says he'll use half of the £330,000 raised for him to buy a house ."}

But he showed no sign of rustiness in the kind of all-action display that has seen him become a cult hero at Old Trafford. In a first-half in which he, unlike fellow senior Radamel Falcao, rarely put a foot wrong Rafael brought the house down with a delightful goal. With United trailing to Kenny McEvoy's neat opener, the defender intercepted a throw from Spurs keeper Luke McGee, chesting it down before clipping a delightful lob over the same man from 30 yards with his left foot.

Although Andy Murray immediately expressed a desire to play the July tie on a grass court, the fact that neither Wimbledon nor the Queen’s Club will be available is believed to be pushing decision makers towards a return to the Emirates Arena. Andy Murray celebrates extravagantly during his straight sets win over John Isner on Sunday . Great Britain supporters would relish supporting Murray and Co in Glasgow again in July . All three day's of Davis Cup action at the Emirates Arena were sold out in a matter of minutes . The only available outdoor grass arena with a big enough capacity is in Eastbourne - but neither the players nor captain Leon Smith are keen on playing at a venue renowned for a lack of atmosphere. The noise and passion of the Scottish crowd played a huge part in the weekend win over the USA, sparking a debate within the LTA over whether that X factor may outweigh any disadvantage that comes from not playing on grass. While Murray prefers it to the indoor hard court, he would be favourite to beat any of his French opponents on any surface – while British No 2 James Ward is actually better when he moves on to the artificial surface, potentially the decisive factor when the final call is made. GB captain Leon Smith doubts the chances of Glasgow being able to create a larger grass-court venue . Smith embraces with  Murray after the latter's straight sets win secured GB's quarter-final berth . Murray (middle) is looked on in envy by his fellow GB team-mates after securing a tie against France . Sportsmail understands that the city authorities are willing to leave the July 17-19 dates clear in the hope of getting the nod over the coming week or so. Unfortunately, because it takes about a week to set up the court, a Bette Midler concert would rule out taking the quarter-final to The Hydro, the city’s biggest indoor venue. But a return to the Emirates, which hosted over 21,000 fans over three days, is very much on the cards. Although no one from Glasgow Life would comment on their plans yesterday, a spokesman said: ‘The atmosphere at the weekend was electric and Glasgow proved, once again, why we are one of the world’s top sporting cities. Any decision on hosting future Davis Cup ties would be for the LTA.’", "completion": "response:\n\nGreat Britain face France in the Davis Cup quarter finals in July .\nThis tie could be held in Glasgow if GB decide atmosphere outweighs the desire to play on a grass court .\nAndy Murray admits his preference is grass, but that playing in Glasgow again with the crowd behind them could be crucial ."}

The double Olympic champion sprinted clear of Kenyan rival Micah Kogo to cross the line in 59 minutes 32 seconds, taking 20 seconds off the mark set by Spain's Fabian Roncero 14 years ago. It was the first time a British athlete had run the 13.1 mile distance in under 60 minutes. Farah, who celebrates his 32nd birthday on Monday, has now set a world record and a European record in his two races so far this year. Mo Farah smashed the European record and completed the race in Lisbon Half Marathon in under 60 minutes . His only race of the indoor campaign, in Birmingham last month, resulted in a new world best time over two miles and this latest success on the road suggests he is in the best possible shape ahead of a season in which he will aim to retain his 5,000 and 10,000 metres titles at the World Championships in Beijing in August. 'It feels amazing, I got massive support from the crowd,' Farah said on www.iaaf.org. 'It wasn't easy, the race organisers put in a great field. To win here was hard, but it's my birthday tomorrow so It's a good birthday present. I feel so happy to break the British record and European record.' The GB Team runner takes a tumble after crossing the finish line and winning the Half Marathon . Farah finished a second ahead of Kogo after the pair had broken clear from another Kenyan, Stephen Kibet, who had to settle for third in 59:58. Farah was content to let the Kenyan pair set the pace before reeling them in with a couple of miles to go. Kibet fell back, but Kogo proved tougher to crack before Farah's superior finishing speed took him clear in the closing metres. The Briton tumbled to the ground after crossing the line, but reported no lasting damage. The runner was delighted with his performance as the outdoor seasons begins to get underway . He said: 'My legs were so tired. Normally when you cross the line you step over the tape, but I was so tired I couldn't lift my legs and tripped over it.' Farah's previous half marathon best was 60:00 at the Bupa Great North Run last September, but that was set on an overall downhill course rather than a looped route. The Lisbon course is flat and fast and was the setting for Eritrea's Zersenay Tadese's world record of 58:23 in 2010.

The Prime Minister had promised to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ by the General Election. However, last month that vow was shattered when figures showed it had hit a record high. David Cameron’s pledge to reduce net migration to the ‘tens of thousands’ is no longer taken seriously by the Office for Budget Responsibility . Home Secretary Theresa May later insisted the Tories would restate the failed target to slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they returned to Government. But yesterday the OBR heaped embarrassment on ministers by criticising the prediction. In a document published alongside the Budget, it said its previous forecasts had been ‘underpinned by the assumption’ that net migration – the measure of how many people have come into Britain minus those who have left – would be 105,000 by 2019. Theresa May said Tories would slash net migration to fewer than 100,000 if they stayed in power . It stated: ‘A reduction over time seems consistent with the international environment and with the Government’s declared efforts to reduce it.’ But in a blow to Mr Cameron, it added: ‘In light of recent evidence, it no longer seems central to assume it will decline so steeply.’ Instead, it said net migration would ‘tend towards 165,000 in the long term’. On taking power in 2010, Mr Cameron pledged to bring the politically-sensitive net migration figure below 100,000. But last month the figure hit 300,000 – fuelled in large part by net migration from outside the EU of 190,000. Downing Street described the figures as a ‘disappointment’ but also a reflection of a growing economy. The highest number previously recorded was 600,000 in September 2010. When Mr Cameron entered Downing Street in May 2010 net migration was running at 244,000.

He was given a suspended sentence for 18 months at Nottingham Crown Court on Friday . A Boots worker who sent a fake bomb to a store on the anniversary of the 7/7 London terror attacks has been spared jail. Ashley Parkes attached a chilling note to the rectangular package, which read: 'Handle with care - bombs explode.' Police were alerted and a store in Leeds, where the parcel was delivered last year, was evacuated until experts examined the package. They quickly discovered it was a hoax and only contained hair dye and blue tissue paper, Nottingham Crown Court was told. The 26-year-old, who worked in a Boots warehouse at the time, admitted dispatching a parcel with the intention of inducing a belief that it was likely to explode or ignite and cause personal injury or damage to property. He was sentenced to 12 months in prison, suspended for 18 months, and ordered to carry out 150 hours of unpaid work. Judge Michael Stokes QC , sentencing, said: 'Sending you immediately to prison would perhaps misrepresent the seriousness of what you did. 'In the present day society anybody who produces a package and even pretends it is a bomb is creating a great deal of trouble and potential risk to innocent people. 'It had been a pathetic attempt by Parkes but it still resulted in a store being evacuated and a great deal of public expense and inconvenience to a large number of people.' Julia King, prosecuting, told the court Parkes sent the hoax bomb after seeing a film on YouTube of gravestones being desecrated. She said: 'It affected him and that was why he acted in the way he did.' Ms King added that the manager had been left shocked and nervous after the incident. The Boots store in Leeds had to be evacuated and experts were called in to examine the package. Above, a stock image of a Boots store in the UK . The court heard Parkes, of Bestwood, Nottingham, has mild learning difficulties and is on medication for depression.

The Caribbean island's prime minister Kenny Anthony said a team of Jamaican investigators had delivered an 'extremely damning' report on the deaths of 12 people shot by officers in 2010 and 2011. Mr Anthony said the report, which has not been made public, revealed that the shootings were 'staged by the police' but reported as murders by unknown assailants. St Lucia's (pictured) police force kept 'death lists' of suspected criminals and planted guns at police shootings to make them look legitimate, according to a report . Guns were allegedly planted by officers and members of the force's high command may have been involved in covering up the truth about the extra-judicial shootings. In a national address late last night, the Caribbean country's leader said: 'The report confirms that 'the blacklist or death lists' referenced by the media, human rights organisations, victims' families and citizens alike did exist.' Alleged tampering with evidence didn't just happen at scenes of police-related fatalities, Mr Anthony disclosed. St Lucia's Prime Minister Kenny Anthony said the report was 'extremely damning' During the investigators' probe, they found that the internet server used by some police commanders was 'deliberately tampered with,' he said. The dozen killings occurred during a police mission called 'Operation Restore Confidence' as the tourism-dependent island grappled with a worrying rise in violent crime. At the time, former prime minister Stephenson King publicly warned criminals that 'no stone will be left unturned and there will be no hiding place for anyone.' Five of the dozen men fatally shot by police were killed in a single operation in the southern town of Vieux Fort. The prime minister said the courts would now decide whether to prosecute officers involved in the shootings. The Jamaican investigation came a year after the U.S. withdrew all assistance to island police, citing concerns about allegations of unlawful killings. Cameron Laure, president of St Lucia's Police Welfare Association, said he was inundated with calls from officers about the 'killings'. 'I don't even know how to react at this point. I will have to meet with the commissioner of police as well as the other members first before making a full statement,' he said.", "completion": "response:\n\nSt Lucia's police allegedly staged shootings of 12 suspected criminals .\nInvestigators claim officers planted guns at the scenes of their crimes .\nCaribbean island's leader says 'death lists' did exist, according to report .\nKillings were part of a police mission called 'Operation Restore Confidence'"}

With their pink woolly noses and whistling speech, the Clangers were among the most memorable children’s TV characters of the 1970s. And fans will be relieved to see they have not changed much as they return to our screens. Last night, the BBC gave viewers the first glimpse of the Clangers, which have been reinvented for a £5million series due to be broadcast in spring. The Clanger family – Major, Mother, Small, Tiny and Granny – are still knitted from wool and look similar to the original series’ characters. They also still live together on the moon in the new series, which will be narrated by actor and presenter Michael Palin. Advances in animation since The Clangers first aired more than 45 years ago will mean some slight differences. ‘We are able to give them more personality – a little twitch of the ear which can say so much,’ said Jackie Edwards, the series’ executive producer. ‘But she added: ‘The new series is very faithful to the original. It is still made with wool and love… there is a magic about The Clangers that’s enduring. You can tell what they’re saying.’ Fans of The Clangers were immediately taken with the teaser, declaring the creatures just as ‘adorable’ as the originals. ‘My four-year old was entrances,’ said one viewer on Twitter. ‘Now this takes me back!’ said another. The original series of The Clangers aired in 1969, and ran for 26 episodes until November 1972. There was also a four-minute election special broadcast in 1974. The £5million new series will be narrated by actor, presenter and comedian Michael Palin, pictured . Last night’s episode explained to children what a solar eclipse is, ahead of the eclipse expected to take place this morning. It stressed that viewers should take care of their sight, only viewing the phenomenon through special goggles. The series has had heavy involvement from Daniel Postgate, the son of Oliver Postgate, who co-created and narrated the original version of The Clangers.", "completion": "response:\n\nMemorable 1970s show has been reinvented for a £5million spring series .\nThe Clangers remake will be narrated by actor and presenter Michael Palin .\nLast night’s episode explained to children what a solar eclipse is ."}

Gordon Strachan says he hasn't brought in any new rules over his Scotland squad in light of Scott Brown's . Strachan was speaking at the national stadium after announcing his squad for the home friendly against Northern Ireland and the Euro qualifier against Gibraltar later in the month. The former Celtic boss has implemented an alcohol ban for all those on Scotland duty and believes that is enough. 'I haven't made rules,' said Strachan. Brown and Strachan pose together when the Scotland skipper signed for Celtic under the boss back in 2007 . 'The only one is the alcohol thing, which is for everybody, not just the players and that hasn't been broken in two and half years. 'Nobody has broken anything, no one has affected anything in the two and half years so I don't have to make rules. 'The players have been immaculate. When they are within my jurisdiction, when I have been responsible, they have been absolutely fantastic.' Brown lifts the Scottish League Cup trophy on Sunday after victory over Dundee United at Hampden Park .", "completion": "response:\n\nScott Brown was pictured after an alleged drunken night out last week .\nScotland manager Gordon Strachan says he sees no need for new rules .\nThe Scotland squad are already under an alcohol ban along with their staff ."}

He said: 'They tried all sorts of mean tricks to get other people to move out, but me and the others won't budge now because we don't want to be bullied.

Last month, the U.S. government approved a law under which Venezuelan officials allegedly involved in human rights violations are to have their visas revoked and their U.S. assets frozen. Following that decision, Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro announced that that Americans will need visas to visit Venezuela. Moreover, a group of prominent U.S. officials, current and retired, will be banned from entering Venezuela because of what Maduro said was their involvement in \"bombing Iraq, Syria and Vietnam\" and other \"terrorist\" actions. The officials include George W.

Goals from Steven Naismith and Romelu Lukaku transformed Everton’s Europa League last 16 tie with Dynamo Kiev, giving Martinez’s side a lead to protect in Ukraine next week when it appeared they were set for another night of misery.

When we get the tempo right and have that expression in our play, we have shown that we are a good team. ‘We need to focus on the league now and get the flow we had in our second half performance. You cannot underestimate how important it is to win in Europe. Our intensity was very pleasing. That was us at our best level. We know that we have got a good side.’ Things looked difficult when Oleg Gusev opened the scoring for Kiev, who have now failed to win in England in 12 attempts, but they struggled to contain Lukaku, who scored his seventh Europa League goal of the campaign. He echoed Martinez’s sentiments in hoping for a domestic spin-off. ‘I'm very happy with the team performance,’ said Lukaku. ‘The team reacted well after first half. We should have maybe scored three goals to be safe but they have top class players. It's up there with my best performances. Now we have to focus on the league as we are not doing too well. ‘Everyone up front was scared to have the ball and we put the defenders and the midfielders in danger, but after 20 minutes we improved.

Mahatma Gandhi, the leader who helped lead India to independence over British rule, was actually an agent for the colonists, a top India judge has claimed. Justice Markandey Ketju said Gandhi deliberately tried to drive a wedge between the country's Hindu and Muslim populations, helping the British to divide and rule. The judge, who is known for making controversial statements, made his comments ahead of the unveiling of a statue of Gandhi in Parliament Square, London. They also came as Foreign Secretary Philip Hammond flies to Delhi for his first official visit, meeting with finance minister Arun Jaitley, who will come to London to see the statue unveiled. Mr Katju, 68, wrote on his personal blog: 'I submit that Gandhi was objectively a British agent who did great harm to India. 'By constantly injecting religion into politics continuously for several decades, Gandhi furthered the British policy of divide and rule.' In a separate post on the same topic, he asks: 'Does such a man, who constantly injected religion into politics, and thereby furthered the British policy of divide and rule, deserve to be called the Father of the Nation? He then goes on to quote from Gandhi's speeches and writings before adding: 'These are only some of the stupid, feudal ideas this \"Father of our nation\" had.' He says the fact that Gandhi peppered his speeches with Hindu phrases and terms pressed Indian Muslims into creating their own separate state, Pakistan, which was founded less than a year before Gandhi was shot dead.

Mr Katju's father was deeply immersed in the Indian freedom movement, and he has made controversial statements on the topic in the past.

The company - worth more than $700 billion - will replace telecom giant AT&T on the list with the switch taking effect after trading closes on Wednesday, March 18. There are only 30 companies listed on the Dow Jones - a price-weighted average of the biggest stocks  - but for a long time Apple was excluded from the pile because its stock price was too high and there was worry it would distort the balance. Apple has finally been accepted to join America’s oldest and most prestigious stock index, the Dow Jones industrial average . However, following Apple's big stock split last summer, this is no longer a problem. The company increased the number of shares it had to reduce the unit price from around $645  to $91. Currently the price rests around $130. With Apple's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones. David Blitzer, managing director and chairman of the index committee at S&P Dow Jones Indices, said there was no need to have two big telecom companies in the equation. Verizon, which has a bigger stock price and larger market value, is in the Dow too. It will step in to lead the sector. With Apple's entry AT&T will leave the Dow Jones with Verizon representing the telecoms sector instead . The last big shake-up of the 119-year old Dow came in September, 2013 when Goldman Sachs, Nike and Visa knocked out Alcoa, Bank of America and Hewlett-Packard. With news of the upcoming changes, Apple's stock rose $2.55, or two per cent, to $128.99 in early trading on Friday. AT&T sank 46 cents, or 1.4 per cent, to $33.54. Apple holds a market capitalization of about $736 billion, making it the largest publicly traded company in the world.

A price war has been triggered by Asda as it claims the elderly are being ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144 million a year. Varifocal lenses are worn by those who need help both with long distances, for example when driving, and reading, due to eye deteroriation which generally occurs with age. The lenses usually come with a premium price – with opticians charging up to £398 for just one pair. However, Asda is challenging the High Street by offering varifocal lenses for the same price as single prescription versions, starting at just £40. The chain will also sell a designer frame option at £70, with two pairs for £99, and a premium range for £100, with two pairs for £159. Asda found that designer frames with varifocal lenses cost up to £398 at Optical Express, £240 at Boots, £211 at Vision Express with UV protection, £188 at Specsavers and £175 at Tesco Opticians. Asda calculated the figure of £144 million by working out the difference in price between its varifocal lenses and competitiors’, judged against the fact that three million pensioners bought varifocal lenses in the last 12 months, according to the Mintel Optical Goods Retailing report. Asda’s director for optical healthcare, Linsey Taylor, said: ‘We have been shocked at how much the optical industry is currently charging its customers for varifocal prescriptions.’ Asda claims the elderly are being ripped off on varifocal glasses by £144 million a year and is now offering them from from £40 . Last night a spokesman for Optical Express said that none of the 20 Asda Opticians it called yesterday sold the same brand of products that it sells.

Teachers should be forced to sit A-level exams along with their pupils, an MP has suggested. Andrew Bridgen wants the Conservative Party to put the proposal in its manifesto and has discussed the issue with Education Secretary Nicky Morgan. Teaching unions have previously cautioned against the move, but Mr Bridgen, MP for North West Leicestershire, said the change was a logical way to drive-up educational standards. He said: 'My idea would be to have the teacher sit the exam themselves, along with the students. 'After all, how can they be expected to pass on their knowledge to students to allow them to succeed in the exam, if they themselves could not? 'This would help improve teaching standards because if a teacher did poorly, this could be looked into and their skills improved upon.' His comments came as it emerged that Michael Gove still plays a leading role in shaping the Government's education policy, according to the Schools Minister. David Laws said the Conservative Chief Whip, who was moved from the Department of Education in last summer's cabinet reshuffle, joins Number 10 and the Treasury in dictating policy rather than education secretary Nicky Morgan. Ms Morgan has previously denied reports Mr Gove was 'back seat driving' as 'nonsense' but Mr Laws, her Liberal Democrat deputy, appeared to undermine her picture of a united front. He told the Independent: 'While Nicky Morgan's instincts are moderate, the people who control education policy in the Conservative Party are still Michael Gove, David Cameron and George Osborne. The Tory MP thinks teachers should sit the exams alongside their pupils to improve standards (file picture) 'The face and language may have changed but the Tory policies haven't.' Last month the Labour Party said that headteachers would receive business and leadership coaching under plans aimed at raising standards and improving management of multi-million pound school budgets. Morgan claimed recently that teachers are ‘working far too hard, for far too long’ and has promised to slash their workload. The Education Secretary lined up with Deputy Prime Minister, Nick Clegg to propose ways to lighten the burden on school staff. This includes not making alterations to qualifications in the academic year or during a course unless in ‘exceptional circumstances’.", "completion": "response:\n\nMP mooted plans with Education Secretary and wants details in manifesto .\nBut teaching unions have previously warned against controversial move ."}

The incident was brought about by the reaction of a number of Hull players after Alex Bruce was booked by referee Jon Moss following a tackle on Riyad Mahrez. Hull City were charged for failing to ensure their players conducted themselves in an orderly fashion . Alex Bruce reacted furiously to being booked by referee Jon Ross for a  challenge on Riyad Mahrez . The findings are something of an embarrassment for Hull, whose manager Steve Bruce criticised the Leicester players for their conduct during the nervy 0-0 draw. He was unimpressed by what he perceived to be attempts to persuade Moss to penalise his son. 'I saw everyone surround Alex (asking) for a red card for his challenge,' he said in the post-match press conference. 'The reason we enjoy the Premier League is its honesty and integrity and if we're going to go down the route of every other league - jumping around and whingeing and trying to get people yellow and red cards - for me that's not right.' Hull City manager Steve Bruce was unhappy with the behaviour of Leicester's players . Hull were handed six bookings in the match, two of which led to Tom Huddlestone's sending-off. Foxes boss Nigel Pearson tersely described Bruce's version as 'not a fair assessment' and the FA's independent regulatory commission were in agreement, attributing blame to the Hull contingent. Their statement read: 'Following an Independent Regulatory Commission hearing, Hull City have been fined £30,000 after an FA player misconduct charge brought against the club was found proven.

The 21-year-old, a Holland international, attracted interest after impressing at the World Cup in Brazil, with Tottenham even tabling a €20million (£14.6m) bid for the forward, which was turned down. But PSV director Toon Gerbrands is resigned to the fact that he is likely to leave when the next transfer window opens in June. Memphis Depay (right), in action on Sunday night against Ajax, is attracting interest from the Premier League . The 21-year-old forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances for PSV Eindhoven so far this season . Louis van Gaal is interested in the player, who he called up to the Holland squad for the World Cup in Brazil . 'Tottenham were willing to offer €20m for Depay,' he told Dutch broadcaster NOS. 'We decided to keep hold of him, but he has the option to leave after this season.' Depay and PSV colleague Georginio Wijnaldum are expected to attract a number of high-profile suitors, with the latter being eyed up by Paris Saint-Germain. 'I think these two players are very attractive to a lot of clubs in Europe,' Gerbrands continued. 'So far, no-one has come forward with an offer but I expect we will come under great pressure.' Depay (left) celebrates with international team-mate Arjen Robben during Holland's game with Chile in 2014 . Depay turned down a move to Tottenham last summer, but could leave for England in the next window . Depay is familiar with current Manchester United manager Louis van Gaal due to their time spent together with Holland, and reports in the summer stated that the player's decision to stay with PSV was heavily influenced by Van Gaal. Therefore, Depay's decision on which club to choose if he does leave PSV may be swayed by Van Gaal and Manchester United, who also have Depay's international team-mate Daley Blind in their ranks. The forward has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances in all competitions this season.", "completion": "response:\n\nMemphis Depay has attracted interest from Man United and Tottenham .\nPSV director Toon Gerbrands admits the forward could leave this summer .\nDepay impressed at the World Cup, with Tottenham offering £14.6million .\nThe 21-year-old has scored 21 goals in 31 appearances so far this season ."}

Germany has signed an agreement to return to its rightful owner an Henri Matisse painting that was seized under Nazi rule. Matisse's 'Woman Sitting in an Armchair' was part of a trove of artworks found in the apartment of late collector Cornelius Gurlitt. Experts say the painting was taken from art dealer Paul Rosenberg and rightfully belongs to his descendants. Culture Minister Monika Gruetters' office confirmed a report in German daily Frankfurter Allgemeine Zeitung today that she signed the agreement. A similar agreement was signed last week for a painting by Max Liebermann. Both agreements must be approved by a Munich court handling Gurlitt's inheritance. A Swiss museum that accepted Gurlitt's bequest of his collection has promised to ensure any Nazi-looted pieces are returned to their Jewish owners' heirs.

Some of the works — including Impressionist and modern masterpieces — had been seized by the Nazis from museums, while others were stolen or bought for a pittance from Jewish collectors who were forced to sell.

He made the students crouch on the floor while he played on his phone and put his bare feet on their backs, People's Daily Online reported. Mr Xie, who has been a teacher for 27 years, was dismissed after the Nan'an City Education Department saw a picture on social media. The image shows both students being made to kneel on the ground in their school uniforms in front of a crowd of pupils. Mr Liu, headteacher, said Mr Xie, who is in his 40s, was supervising a small self-study group around 7.30pm when the two students were too noisy. The Year One pupils - thought to be aged between six and seven - were taken into a different room and told to kneel on the ground. Mr Liu said the footstool photo was taken as a joke and added that Mr Xie, who was in charge of disciplining the male students at the school, 'performed well in his work and was extremely talented'. Nan'an City Department of Education said it took immediate action. It requested the school apologise to students and parents, and said that student counselling should also be offered.

It is believed the 6in long enamel and diamond decoration that fixed onto the bottom end of the naval hero's sword case was tossed into the water by thieves decades before. It was discovered in 1973 purely by chance by a police diver searching for a weapon used in a crime. Admiral Lord Nelson's sword scabbard (pictured) is set to sell at auction for up to £70,000 . The chape was from a scimitar sword presented to Nelson by the Sultan Selim III of the Turkish Empire to commemorate the British victory over the French fleet at the Battle of the Nile in 1798. It is decorated in diamonds with the star and crescent which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent granted to Nelson in 1799. The locket no longer exists as it was melted down years ago but the chape is now coming up for auction in London with a pre-sale estimate of £50,000 to £70,000. The one-armed naval hero (illustrated) was famed for his victories at sea, mostly notably the 1805 Battle of Trafalgar . Michael Moorcroft, of auctioneers Bonhams, said: 'The chape would have been a super-expensive item of the day. 'We can associate it with Nelson through the star and crescent at the centre of the decoration which matches the Ottoman Order of the Crescent conferred on Nelson in 1799 and as seen in a portrait of him in 1801. 'The sheer quality of workmanship that has gone into it is quite stunning. 'It is an object that is pretty fabulous.' Five years before its discovery, an ornate locket with an identical decoration that was used on the top part of Nelson's scabbard was found during dredging work of the River Wey in Surrey. The location wasn't far from the Thames at Windsor where the chape was found, nor from Nelson's palatial home at Merton. Both discoveries were featured on BBC's Blue Peter. Mr Moorcroft added: 'Both the locket and the chape were found at the bottom of rivers just five years and a few miles apart. The locket was found about 20 miles from Nelson's estate at Merton.

Few would disagree that the show's first season was its best, winning over a dedicated fan base who stuck with the show through an uneven six seasons and the loss of star Cory Monteith. For its final episode Friday night, the show that made it cool to join the high school glee club focused on core characters introduced in the first season. The first hour of Friday's season finale, aptly titled \"2009,\" was a retelling of the first episode, which included a memorable performance of Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" by the original members of William McKinley High School's glee club. Instead of telling it again through Finn's perspective, the finale showed what led the other characters to join New Directions, culminating in an edited version of the performance that packed an emotional punch by featuring Monteith. The second hour brought us to the present day, with Will passing New Directions on to Sam so he can take charge of McKinley High as a fine arts school. We saw the characters' dreams come true in a requisite flash-forward to the future: Rachel (now married to Jesse) wins a Tony Award; Mercedes sings with Beyonce; Kurt and Blaine are successful Broadway stars; and most amazing of all, Vice President Sue Sylvester starts her second term in the Jeb Bush administration. The entirety of New Directions, past and present, gathered one last time in the auditorium, now named after Finn.

The monastery is funded entirely by Asia's richest man, Li Ka-shing, who contributed $193 million from his personal foundation to the building project. The premises, styled on Tang dynasty buildings, sprawl across a lush, green area of 500,000 square feet - around nine football fields. It can accommodate up to 400 to 500 visitors daily, but will not be open to tour groups in order to preserve the sacred atmosphere. Li initiated the project in 2003 to promote Buddhism in the city and construction took five years to complete. At a height of 76 meters (250 feet), the Goddess of Mercy statue overlooks the site and a breathtaking view of Hong Kong's harbor and several islands. The monastery also features several grand halls, including one which houses three ornate 24-karat gold plated Buddhist statues, where people can meditate, and learn about Buddhism. But perhaps the most intriguing feature is the bulletproof dormitory rooms. One of the three dormitories that provide housing for visiting monks from all over world has built-in bulletproof windows to protect \"important guests.\" \"We installed the bulletproof glass windows because we hoped there could be a place to protect our important guests such as the Supreme Patriarch of Thailand and other top monks,\" Walter Ngai Kai-shu, secretary general of the monastery told local media. The rooms are still empty, and Ngai added that they were not designed for Li or any specific individual, reported the South China Morning Post. Visitors are not allowed to bring joss sticks, meat, alcohol, or other food offerings in order to be environmentally friendly --- instead the monastery will provide water. \"There are many other ways to offer the Buddha apart from joss sticks,\" Ngai told local media. Currently, a dozen monks, mainly from Hong Kong and Southeast Asia reside inside the monastery. It will be open to the public on April 15, but registration and booking is now available online.

The auction house is offering an untitled work by Italian sculptor Maurizio Cattelan that chronicles -- in painstaking and painful detail if you are English -- every defeat suffered by the England team between 1874 and 1998. Cattelan has carved all the defeats into a large (and it would have to be, wouldn't it?) piece of black granite, meaning the lucky buyer can be constantly reminded of a succession of ignominious afternoons and evenings. The artist says of his memorial stone-style work simply: \"I guess it's a piece which talks about pride, missed opportunities and death.\" Known for his humorous and satirical art, Cattelan had plenty to work with as he recorded defeats starting with a 2-1 loss to Scotland in Glasgow in 1874 and ending with another 2-1 setback against Romania at the 1998 World Cup. Since then, of course, he'd have had a fair few more to immortalize, including the two to Italy and Uruguay in Brazil last summer that were part of the worst-ever England display at a World Cup. The artist, whose other works include La Nona Ora (The Ninth Hour), which depicts Pope John Paul II being struck down by a meteorite, first put his football piece on display at an exhibition in London in 1999. It's not known whether any England managers and players, past or present, came along to have a sneaky look. Current England boss Roy Hodgson is known to be a bit of an Italophile, but the former Inter Milan coach needs to be quick if he wants catch a glimpse -- Cattelan's work is on public exhibition at Sotheby's New Bond Street galleries until Tuesday 10 March.

Seven-year-old Rosie was attacked in the back garden of her owner Jean Hull, and vets said she was 'almost split in two' following her ordeal. Mrs Hull resolved to do all she could to save the bird's life, because she was the favourite pet of her late husband Maurice, and spent five months nursing her back to health. Scroll down for video . Injured: Rosie the chicken was attacked by a fox in her owner's garden in Sussex last November . Rosie underwent a pioneering physio procedure which involved her limbs being carefully manipulated and exercises to build up her strength. Mrs Hull, from High Salvington in Sussex, said: 'She clearly wanted to live and wasn't going to let that fox beat her. 'She was my late husband's favourite, so that is where the extra feeling comes from. She is a little bit of him.' The couple bought Rosie and another hen in 2008 because they could not find eggs which were both fresh and organic. But in November last year, she was suddenly grabbed by a fox while she was running free in the garden. Treatment: Rosie has since undergone a new form of avian physiotherapy to help her recover . Stretches: The treatment involves manipulating her limbs to enable her to walk normally again . Mrs Hull said: 'This fox came whizzing down the garden and grabbed her and dashed down the bottom of the garden. I screamed and I just had to try to stop the fox. 'Eventually, the fox did drop her and ran off but Rosie was just laying there bleeding and there were feathers everywhere.' Rosie was rushed to a nearby vet's office, where Tania Parsons carried out emergency surgery to save her. But as the chicken recovered she was having difficulty walking because of the scar tissue which had formed over her wounds. Hale and hearty: The physio has apparently been a success and Rosie is now back to full health . Ms Parsons said: 'Last year, Rosie came in almost split in two and had to have quite major surgery to stitch her back together. 'I had never heard of physiotherapy for chickens but she responded to it really well. 'I've only seen it done on chickens on YouTube videos in America. Rosie is a very special hen and Jean looks after her very well.'

Nick Clegg yesterday handed over £150,000 of public money to promote a language barely anyone speaks. The Lib Dem leader’s generosity to the handful of Cornish speakers is the latest in a series of extraordinary gestures to the county over recent months. Yesterday’s handout brings Coalition spending on attempts to revive Cornish to £500,000 – enough to give nearly £900 to every person who speaks it. The Deputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls. It comes a week after the party announced a drop in fuel prices that mainly benefits areas full of Lib Dem voters. The 5p cut on fuel duty covers 17 rural areas, 14 of which are Lib Dem seats. Three of Cornwall’s six MPs are Lib Dems with slim majorities and Mr Clegg even chose to visit the county rather than attend the Commons on the day Chancellor George Osborne presented his Autumn Statement in December. Mr Clegg said: ‘I am determined to keep [Cornish] alive and thriving. ‘Great efforts have been made to revive and return Cornish to common use. It would be a crime to let such a distinct language disappear again.’ Cornish has not been widely used since the 18th century. At the 2011 census 557 people listed it as their first language. Last April, Lib Dems persuaded the Council of Europe to recognise Cornish people as a ‘national minority’ in England, which means the Government is now pledged to ‘combat discrimination’ against them. Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said: ‘I don’t know what the Cornish is for a blatant electoral bribe, but with £150,000 of taxpayers’ money I’m sure that Nick Clegg can tell us. It would appear that Mr Clegg is trying to buy votes with public money.’ The money will go to the Cornish Language Partnership, an organisation financed by taxpayers and run by activists and local council nominees. Mr Clegg said yesterday he will stay on as a caretaker deputy prime minister if there is a hung parliament because the country will need a government in place to ‘keep the lights on’. He confirmed he was prepared to stay on while coalition talks are hammered out, which could take weeks or months.", "completion": "response:\n\nLiberal Democrat leader’s generosity to handful of Cornish speakers is latest in series of extraordinary gestures to county over recent months .\nHandout brings Coalition spending aimed at reviving Cornish to £500,000 .\nDeputy Prime Minister’s interest in Cornish provoked cynicism among opponents, who pointed to his party’s lowly status in the polls ."}

Before it was removed, the marquee read: 'Remember Satan was the first to demand equal rights.' Scroll down for video . The Knoxville Baptist Tabernacle posted the controversial message (pictured), but then took it down later . Many people felt the sign was meant to offend those who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender . Pastor Tony Greene said the message on the marquee was 'not a statement against any one group in particular' After the message was posted, it began being shared on the Facebook and Twitter pages of WATE. Many people felt the sign was meant to offend individuals who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender, but the Tabernacle's pastor said that was not the case. Pastor Tony Greene said: 'Our sign referencing Satan demanding his equal rights to ascend into the heavens and be God was simply all about that individual. 'It was not a statement against any one group in particular, you know what about the rights of the unborn babies, the rights of children, the rights of everyone?' Some did not buy Greene's explanation. Andy Henry told WBIR: 'It's clearly a sign that was meant to offend a particular community - the LGBT community. 'Because of (the church's) lack of foresight, they ended up offending everybody who had ever fought for equality or civil rights in general.' The sign was changed to read: 'Glad you reading, did not intend to offend, we all need Christ.' Greene said: 'We are a diversity congregation of people.

Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened nearly 40 years ago but after a new terminal was opened in the town last year the 'infamously ugly' building has lain redundant. It faced criticism soon after it opened in 1976 after mineral stalactites began forming inside and in 2005 it was voted third in a list of 12 buildings that should be demolished for a Channel 4 series. Greyfriars bus station in Northampton, East Midlands, opened in 1976 but will be reduced to rubble tomorrow . The programme, titled Demolition, was fronted by broadcaster McCloud when he compared the building to the 'mouth of hell'. It was described in the Lonely Planet guide as 'infamously ugly'. There were also concerns for the safety of the bus station after two people died when they were hit by buses inside the station in the 2000s.

David Macintosh, leader of Northampton Borough Council, said: 'It's funny because in the last couple of months, people have said \"We will miss it.\" 'It's not very well-liked, and is now redundant. \"The mouth of hell' sums it up perfectly.\" Alan Carr, who spent some of his childhood in Northampton, wrote on Twitter: 'Is that smelly cafe still there in the basement in Greyfriars bus station? You'd see people dry heaving before they got on their buses.' The four-acre site takes up a large part of the town centre, and the council has set up an exclusion zone - and is evacuating 414 nearby homes as a precaution. Northampton Borough Council is live-streaming the demolition of the building, and urged spectators to watch it online rather than in person. The council said the structure is costing taxpayers £500,000 in repairs every year, and it would take almost £30 million to renovate. Its demolition is part of Northampton's regeneration programme and plans for new retail and leisure schemes are being considered. The town's new bus station has also had its problems with police being called in to direct traffic after queues of buses formed.", "completion": "response:\n\nGreyfriars bus station opened in 1976 but has lain redundant in last year .\nFaced criticism and was dubbed 'infamously ugly' by Lonely Planet guide .\nVoted to be demolished in Channel 4 programme narrated by McCloud .\nOld bus station will be 'blown down' by demolition company tomorrow .\nCouncil will live stream the four-acres site as it is reduced to rubble ."}

Falcao, on a season-long loan at Old Trafford from Monaco, has been a huge disappointment having notched just four goals in 20 appearances since moving to the Barclays Premier League. A series of poor performances have seen him left out of Louis van Gaal's side of late and with Monaco expecting a fee for around £40million for the former Atletico Madrid striker in the summer, United face a tough decision over his future.

'His form has been very poor in fact, we haven't seen anything like the player who absolutely destroyed Chelsea with Atletico Madrid a few years back,' he said.

According to shanghaiist.com, she posted several pictures to her page on the Chinese social networking site Weibo, gushing about how much she had enjoyed the experience of takeoff and landing. Responding to the posts,  some Weibo users expressed fears about security because most airlines have made it virtually impossible for passengers to access the cockpit post-9/11.

An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of some 300 beaches. It also found a sharp rise in litter overall in parts of the UK. Rubbish on some beaches in the South West increased by 89 per cent in 2014 compared with the year before, the MCS found. An average of 56 wipes per mile were retrieved in the Marine Conservation Society’s annual clean-up of 300 of Britain's beaches . Popular holiday destinations in Cornwall were among the worst, including Porthpean, Porthtowan, Gwithian and Gunwalloe Fishing Cove. The MCS complained that wet wipes – which are being used to remove make-up, replace toilet paper and apply fake tan – do not disintegrate like toilet paper, which means they survive being flushed or thrown away. Earlier this year, Southern Water revealed more than 2,000 tons of wet wipes were playing havoc with sewers in Kent. Research for United Utilities in the North West showed one in ten households have had blocked toilets and drains due to baby wipes and make-up wipes. Charlotte Coombes of the MCS said the wipes should be thrown in the bin, not down the toilet, adding: ‘Our sewerage systems weren’t built to cope with wet wipes … they typically contain plastic so once they reach the sea they last for a very long time. ‘They can cause blockages in our sewers, then everything else that has been flushed down the loo can either back up into people’s homes, or overflow into rivers and seas. ‘Overflows also happen during excessive rainfall, or if the plumbing hasn’t been connected up properly, meaning the wrong pipes are heading straight to the sea. That’s when we find sewage-related debris, including wet wipes, on the beach.’ Plastic bottles and aluminium cans made up 10 per cent of the litter found in the MCS clean-up in September. The charity called for the introduction of a refund of 10p-30p for containers that are returned for recycling.

It stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Noah . It is one of the strongest biblical images learned in childhood – the animals entering Noah’s Ark two-by-two. But BBC 1 drama The Ark, to be shown over Easter, will not include the iconic scene – because writer Tony Jordan doesn’t want it to feel ‘like Peppa Pig’. Jordan, best known for his work on EastEnders, said: ‘What we have done with Noah in the past is to change it into a children’s story. It’s like a version of Peppa Pig. ‘Every time someone makes a film, they have the ramp and then the two crocodiles followed by two ducks. It’s all rubbish.’ The Ark, which stars Shameless actor David Threlfall as Noah, also ignores the scene where a dove carries an olive leaf to Noah to let him know the flood is receding. But the changes do not please traditionalists. Theologian Bishop Michael Nazir-Ali said: ‘The animals are an integral part of the story because it is about the whole of creation, not just human beings. 'Then the dove coming back with the olive leaf, that is about calmness and the return to order.’ The gritty depiction of Noah may also surprise traditionalists. In one scene he headbutts a thief and in another his sons talk about the impossibility of making love to their wives in such cramped conditions. Jordan said his irreverent approach to the original material was about revealing the wider truth in the story, adding: ‘The characters are supposed to be human beings.’ The writer said he chose not to include the scene because he doesn’t want it to feel ‘like Peppa Pig’ (pictured)", "completion": "response:\n\nBBC drama which will be shown over Easter will not feature iconic scene .\nAnimals entering Ark two-by-two is one of the most famous biblical images .\nThe Ark writer Tony Jordan said he does not want it to feel 'like Peppa Pig'\nChange not been welcomed by traditionalists who see scene as integral ."}

Gov. Mike Pence issued the order Thursday for Scott County, which has 79 confirmed cases of HIV since mid-December. The county averages about five new cases a year. \"Scott County is facing an epidemic of HIV, but this is not a Scott County problem; this is an Indiana problem,\"  Pence said in a news release. All the cases in the current outbreak are linked to injection drug use, primarily of the prescription opioid opana. The declaration requires law enforcement, emergency agencies and health officials to develop a response plan that also includes hospitals and health care providers. A team from the CDC Division of HIV/AIDS Prevention arrived Monday and is working with local and state health officials to stop the outbreak. Their recommendations include a  short-term needle exchange program and public awareness campaign focusing on safe sex, needle disposal, addiction services, and HIV testing and treatment. HIV can take up to three months to appear in a person's system after they are infected.

Captured at 1,500 frames per second, the video shows the chameleon attacking a cricket with remarkable speed and skill. To do this, the Panther chameleon shoots out its tongue to almost twice its body length in little more than 0.07 seconds. Scroll down for video . A slow motion video of a chameleon as it snares its prey has revealed its tongue acrobatics in incredible detail. Captured at 1,500 frames per second, this screenshot shows the chameleon attacking a cricket . The video, captured by BBC Earth Unplugged, reveals how the tongue reaches around 41G - is four times faster than the maximum acceleration of a fighter jet. The creatures have a bone in the base of their tongue which fixes the powerful muscles, along with special tissue that effectively works as a spring. When a muscle called the long accelerator contracts, the retractor muscles relaxes. This causes other muscles to press against collagen springs, giving it incredible power and speed. Location: Northern parts of Madagascar, Réunion and Mauritius. Size: Male panther chameleons can grow up to 20 inches in length, with a typical length of around 17 in (45 cm). Females are smaller, at about half the size. Lifespan: Two to five years . Reproduction: Panther chameleons reach sexual maturity at a minimum age of seven months. Females usually live only two to three years after giving birth. The tongue’s tip is a bulbous ball of muscle, and as it hits its prey it forms a small suction cup. With eyes that operate independently like gun turrets, the remarkable reptile also has a full 360-degree arc of vision around itself. In January, new measurements showed a chameleon tongue moving with the highest power yet documented for a vertebrate motion. The South African chameleon species Bradypodion thamnobates releases its tongue with up to 41,000 watts of power per kilogram of muscle involved. Previous studies didn’t record anything so high because they focused on larger chameleons, the Brown University study said. When comparing body-size relationship with tongue performance, smaller species had tongues that were much more powerful that bigger ones in various mouth athletics.

Liverpool midfielder Jordan Henderson (left) pressures Manchester City's James Milner for the ball . Liverpool playmaker Philippe Coutinho (right) had an outstanding game against Manchester City . 'If I was a Manchester City player, I'd be embarrassed how easy it is to play through them,' Neville said during live commentary on Sky Sports. 'We're judging Manchester City as champions of the Premier League. There has to be progression year on year, you have to get better. But this team, we keep seeing the same mistakes being made' Prior to the Liverpool game, questions had been raised over Pellegrini's decision to play with two strikers and leave his midfield exposed. With flair players David Silva and Samir Nasri also not fulfilling their defensive duties, the Chilean's bold selections appeared to have signalled some oversight. And in the post-match analysis, Carragher offered his opinion: 'To employ that system (4-4-2) in the big games is so naive. It's embarrassing really for a manager at that level to go into a game against Barcelona two years running and then again at Anfield like this.

Bachelet visited 14-year-old Valentina Maureira on Saturday after the girl's video went viral and spurred debate in Chile about euthanasia. Valentina was diagnosed with cystic fibrosis when she was 6. Her older brother died from the same disease. Cystic fibrosis is a life-threatening disease that damages the lungs and digestive system. Valentina's family has already witnessed how the disease can be terminal. Valentina's suffering includes vomiting and headaches that are constant, according to her father, Freddy Maureira. The teen recently posted a video on her Facebook page, asking Bachelet to allow her to end her life. \"I am tired of living with this sickness,\" Valentina says in the video. \"Please authorize an injection so I can sleep forever.\" Bachelet visited Valentina on Saturday for more than an hour at the hospital. The country's minister of health also attended. During the visit, the President learned details about Valentina's health, whose condition has reportedly slightly improved, CNN Chile reported. The teen thanked Bachelet for the visit, and her father said he is holding on to hope for a lung transplant for his daughter, according to CNN Chile. Before the visit, the President had already stated her position on the impossibility of an assisted suicide for the girl. Not even the President can agree to Valentina's request because Chilean law does not allow euthanasia, Presidential spokesman Alvaro Elizaldo said. \"But what are we doing?\" Elizaldo said last week. \"The health ministry is in constant contact with Valentina's family, and we will provide all the emotional and psychological support and medical treatment to improve her living conditions.\" Valentina's case has caused an overwhelming response on social media.

Opening ceremonies in the Iditarod Trail Sled Dog Race kick off Saturday in Anchorage. When the race begins Monday, mushers will cross the starting line in Fairbanks instead of Willow, the traditional starting point. It's the second time in the race's 43-year history that the starting point has moved from Willow to Fairbanks because of weather-related issues, an Iditarod spokesperson said. The first time was in 2003. While cities across the northeastern United States have seen record snowfall this winter, Alaska received less snow than usual. Anchorage collected only 20 inches of snow this season, compared with a seasonal average of 60 inches. Race organizers made the unanimous decision in February to move the race after determining that conditions were worse than last year in critical areas, and \"therefore not safe enough for the upcoming race,\" Iditarod Chief Executive Stan Hooley said in a press release. While snow has fallen east of the Alaska Range over the past couple of weeks, other parts of the trail did not get much or any of it, Hooley told CNN affiliate KTVA-TV in February. The racing course spans a 1,000-mile trail across the Arctic tundra, ending in Nome. The race usually takes 10 days to finish, although Dallas Seavey finished the race in 2014 in a record time of eight days, 13 hours, four seconds, and 19 minutes. The lack of snow could be attributed to a highly amplified jet stream that brought warm air from the Pacific to the region, said meteorologist  Dave Snider with the National Weather Service in Anchorage. \"It's the same weather pattern that brought the east coast such snowy and cold weather this season.  Alaska was simply on the warmer side of this weather pattern,\" he said. Warm sea surface temperatures along the Alaska coastline are another reason for milder conditions, he added.", "completion": "response:\n\nAlaska's famed Iditarod race starts Saturday .\na lack of snow forces the starting point to move 225 miles north .\nWarm air from the Pacific has affected weather conditions in Alaska ."}

He told ABC News that he hauled the cow, named Leroy, to his backyard and jumped with it into his heated bath full-dressed. Doting farmer: Dean Gangwer ,46, from Cutler, Indiana, went above and beyond to save a freezing calf by spending an hour with it in a hot tub . Indeed, photographs show Gangwer sat with the creature in the water with his T-shirt on and his spectacles slightly steamed up. In a bid to stop the young cow from drowning, Gangwer is seen supporting his head above the surface. After about 60 minutes the animal was apparently warmed up. Gangwer then carried it into his home and bundled it up in a pile of heated electric blankets. The third-generation farmer says that Leroy's mother wandered away from the herd and gave birth in a snowbank. On the road to recovery: He later carried the animal into his home and bundled it up in electric blankets . Sense of humor: Gangwer joked that Leroy is 'done hot-tubbing' but 'sunbathing is definitely in his future out in the grass' But in freezing weather, the decision to go off alone almost proved fatal for her young. Luckily Gangwer got to the scene just in the nick of time. Leroy is now fully-recovered from the chilly ordeal and has started to nurse. Gangwer joked that Leroy is 'done hot tubbing' but 'sunbathing is definitely in his future out in the grass.' He says luckily his wife loves animals as much as he does and she has cleaned the house after Leroy's impromptu visit. However, Gangwer added: 'She is leaving the hot tub for me to deal will. You never know what you might have to do when you live on the farm.' Many people have applauded the farmer's quick-thinking antics, with one commenter noting in jest: 'You could have just thrown some potatoes, onions and carrots in the hot tub and had dinner.'

If Petr Cech, at 33, is available in the summer, and Arsenal have a chance of buying him, what should be Arsene Wenger's best offer? Jose Mourinho says Cech can leave Chelsea if he wishes, but only for big money as he rates him one of the top three goalkeepers in the world. The three most expensive goalkeepers so far: Gianluigi Buffon (£32.6m), Manuel Neuer (£19m) and David De Gea (£18m) – although all were 25 or under when they made their move. Chelsea manager Jose Mourinho has said goalkeeper Petr Cech can leave Stamford Bridge in the summer .

A better marker may be the £9m Liverpool paid for Simon Mignolet. Is Cech better than Mignolet? Yes. So if Chelsea asked for £10m for a 33-year-old reserve, should Arsenal be tempted? Yes again. The absence of a world class goalkeeper is holding Arsenal back. Cech could easily last another four years at the top, making him value at £10m. Pat Jennings was 32 when he switched from Tottenham Hotspur to Arsenal in 1977; he played his last game for the club in 1985 at the age of 39.

The low-cost carrier just acquired its 69th plane and is celebrating with $69 round-trip fares in April and May that include taxes and fees -- although additional baggage charges may apply. Round-trip purchase is not required, so you could actually pay $34.50 for a one-way flight. But the airline is getting more attention for its cheeky ad copy, which obliquely references a sexual act. \"We've been waiting to hit 69 planes for years,\" reads the offer on Spirit's website. \"It's our favorite number -- ever since we were twelve and found that magazine under our brother's bed (the one with the fantastic articles). Use your mouth to spread the word: Spirit is in an even better position to get you where you're going.\" Some observers say the promotion is sophomoric and has crossed the limits of good taste. \"You can't object to that price point, but you certainly can object to the discount airline's marketing strategy, which is so juvenile it led us to wonder if Spirit's website was hacked,\" wrote Aaron Rupar of KMSP in Minneapolis. Spirit spokesman Paul Berry, in a prepared statement, said the promotion reflects the airline's quirky culture. \"Spirit isn't your typical airline and we don't want to be. We enjoy being different than other airlines,\" said Berry, Spirit's director of corporate communications. \"When it comes to advertising, different means we don't spend a lot of money on advertising -- because that just increases fares.  But we're also different because our ads are fun, provocative, sometimes silly and often irreverent. They get lots of attention,\" he added. \"The vast majority of our customers find these types of ads humorous and accept them for what they are. We understand there is a small group of people who feel differently.\" The $69 fares must be booked by the end of the day Tuesday. Questionable taste or not, the promotion may be working: People were complaining on Twitter that they couldn't access Spirit's website to book flights.

Clueless criminal: Christopher Miller (pictured in 1999, left, and more recently, right) robbed the same store twice .

He then took the workers' mobile phones and the store phone, and fled on foot. Police said they found Miller a few blocks away, with the cash stashed in a gutter and the phones in a garbage can.

Christie, 54, is the subject of an ITV4 documentary on Tuesday, which offers a rare insight into the psyche of one of Britain’s greatest but most controversial sportsmen. He recalls two alleged racist incidents, the first shortly after he won a gold medal at the European Indoor Championships in 1986. Linford Christie, now an athletics coach, has spoken of allegedly racist treatment at the hands of policeman . ‘I remember when I got my Great Britain tracksuit, I was so proud,’ he said. ‘I walked along Shepherd’s Bush, this policeman started saying, “What’s a n***** like you doing in a British tracksuit?” 'I went into a chip shop and came out of the shop, and he jumped me, twisted my arm behind my back, and arrested me. The next day they dropped all charges. It was just so stupid.’ Another time, he said, police refused to believe he was the owner of a sponsored car and arrested him. Christie claims to have been arrested by a 'racist' policeman after winning the European Indoors in 1986 . ‘A couple of days later the police dropped a letter which said, “You don’t need to come back any more, we’ve made our enquiries”. ‘I said, “I still want an apology”, and they totally refused.’ Christie threatened court proceedings and the police eventually apologised.

The Spaniard missed the opening race of the season in Melbourne last week after suffering concussion in an unexplained testing accident in Barcelona. Although Alonso has since posted Twitter messages declaring himself fit and ready, the FIA have appointed three Cambridge doctors to test him. If he passes these tests, he will travel to Kuala Lumpur for two further sets of analysis. Fernando Alonso will undergo tests at Cambridge University ahead of a potential comeback in Malaysia . One will be carried out by the FIA’s medical delegate, Jean-Charles Piette, who will require Alonso to do a 45-minute computer test to assess his reaction times. His score will be compared with his previous results on the same test. The local doctor at the Sepang International Circuit will also examine Alonso. Alonso missed the Australian Grand Prix after a crash in pre-season testing in Barcelona . The belts-and-braces approach shows the concern among the Formula One community about how Alonso, 33, came to lose control of his McLaren last month.

The trio thought they had come across a stash of cocaine and took it from the house along with a necklace worth $500, a Xbox 360 game system,  bottles of prescription drugs oxycodone and morphine, and over $800 in cash, reports the St. Louis Post- Dispatch. But when they tasted the ashes, which were in a wooden box, they realized their mistake - and threw the homeowner's father's ashes out of the car. Gessel later told the police they could not remember where they threw them out so police have not been able to retrieve them. According to police, the three knew the family who lived at the home and planned the burglary after seeing a Facebook post which indicated they were going to be away. But they were caught after police tracked them through an IP address used on the Xbox. Gesell was charged this week with burglary and two counts of theft.

Research found families across Britain are hoarding a staggering eight billion books – but one in five is unread.

Damaging: Fifty Shades of Grey was not a book people thought would impress guests, according to the survey . But 16 per cent admitted they keep certain titles on their shelves to make them look more intelligent. Those deemed most likely to impress guests included To Kill a Mockingbird, Moby-Dick and the Bible. However, Katie Price’s autobiography, Fifty Shades of Grey and anything by James Patterson topped the list of books readers thought would damage their reputation.

A third of those asked said they hoard books because they hate throwing anything away and 20 per cent keep their collection to pass on to children. Duncan Bell, Shurgard’s operations director, said: ‘We were surprised to hear the innovative ways people store their books, but holding onto your books doesn’t mean they need to take over your house. ‘A self-storage unit could be a convenient solution for storing those classics for future generations whilst also keeping your hallways clear.’", "completion": "response:\n\nFamilies across Britain have 8 billion books but one in five is unread .\nHalf those asked said they become 'emotionally attached' to books .\nMany said they kept titles on shelves to look more intelligent .\nFavourites to impress include To Kill a Mockingbird and Moby Dick .\nBritain's book collection enough to fill Wembley Stadium 16,000 times ."}

The worrying incident occurred in the first half at White Hart Lane -- after Tottenham scored in the seventh minute -- but the 29-year-old left the pitch conscious following about five minutes of treatment. The Guardian added that he was wearing an oxygen mask. Play was temporarily stopped before resuming. As the match progressed, Swansea tweeted that Gomis was \"fine,\" with manager Garry Monk using the same word to describe Gomis' condition. Gomis spent the night in hospital as a precaution, Swansea said on its website. \"I wanted to reassure you concerning my health,\" Gomis told the website. \"It actually looks much scarier than it is physically dangerous, and I am feeling well now. \"I have been under a great deal of stress and fatigue due to my father's health, which requires me to go back and forth from France. \"I was disappointed that I couldn't help my team tonight, but now everything is back in order.

Although Arsene Wenger has guided the Gunners to  Champions League qualification for an impressive 17 consecutive seasons, the 2004 champions have arguably not mounted a serious tilt at the title for five years.

'We believe we can do it and I'm confident we will. If we didn't believe we wouldn't be here. Football is not predictable. 'We totally missed the first leg, which was surprising.

Murderous mother-in-law: Tatiana Kudinova, left, hired a hitman to kill her 30-year-old daughter-in-law Roxanne after she got tired of the latter making fun of her financial situation . Kudinova claims she fell out with her daughter-in-law after a party when the pair started arguing about who should pay for the food for the guests. After this, she says Roxanne kept making jokes about her being a 'skinflint mother-in-law', which irritated her so much she wanted her dead. Kudinova, from Rostov, southern Russia, then contacted a local criminal gang, offering them £1,200 to kill Roxanne. According to police, Kudinova told the gang; 'I don't care how she dies, I only want you to kill her' What she did not realise was that the man she paid a £600 deposit to was in fact an undercover policeman. Caught: The 'local criminal' Kudinova paid to kill her daughter-in-law was, in fact, an undercover police officer . Officers then devised an elaborate sting to catch Kudinova by faking Roxanne's death and taking photos of her 'corpse'. A police spokesman said: 'We needed to catch her in the act of paying for the murder and giving an advance payment was not enough.

Mick Schumacher was racing through the Lausitzring speedway in Brandenburg, eastern Germany, when he skidded out of control and onto the gravel, it was reported. The young protege began karting seven years ago, and this year reached the German Formula 4 - a racing category used as a stepping stone by junior drivers. Mick Schumacher (pictured), 15, crashed while testing a Formula 4 car on a race track in east Germany . Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season (pictured) but this year has begun practicing for his first year in the Formula 4 . However, German newspaper Die Welt reported that the crash was minor and Mick walked away from the accident uninjured. His father, who remains recovering from a December 2013 ski accident at his home in Switzerland, has won a record seven Formula 1 world titles and 91 races. Mick signed a contract with Van Amersfoort Racing to drive in the Formula 4, a series for young talents, earlier this month. At the time, the Dutch team's owner Frits van Amersfoort said: 'We have watched his skills in test driving and are looking forward to a successful season.' Mick finished second in the world, European and German kart championships last season. His father emerged from his induced coma in June last year, and left hospital in September. He has since started to recognise family members, according to someone claiming to be a family friend. Philippe Streiff, a former Formula 1 driver, told French media Schumacher 'has yet to recover the power of speech' but is 'nevertheless starting to recognise those close to him'. However, Schumacher's manager has disputed the comments, saying the 46-year-old faces a 'long fight' for recovery and that Streiff is not a family friend. 'We need a long time,' Sabine Kehm said.

Because you may not have any gefilte fish at your table on Passover, which starts at sundown on April 3. February's record cold temperatures are to blame for the shortage of fish ingredients, reported Erica Marcus, a food writer at Newsday, the Long Island, New York, newspaper. \"The traditional Passover appetizer is made from ground whitefish, carp and yellow pike,\" Marcus wrote. \"All three are freshwater fish from the Upper Midwest, and all three are in short supply this spring because the Great Lakes are still covered with ice.\" While some restaurants reported having no supply issues, it may be a different story for the home cook. There's great debate within the Jewish community about the flavor of the classic gefilte fish dish, which isn't always the tastiest food at the table. \"I've never seen what all the fuss is about,\" Marcus told CNN. \"It's about as challenging a taste as tuna fish salad.\" The fishing boats just can't sail or fish on frozen lakes. Many of the Great Lakes are still partially frozen over, according to fisheries expert Ronald Kinnunen, an educator with Michigan State University's Sea Grant Extension Program. \"Nobody's getting their fishing boats out,\"  Kinnunen said. \"I'm looking at the satellite images and Lake Superior's half covered in ice,\" he said. It's still iced over at the Mackinac Bridge, where Lake Huron and Lake Michigan come together at the Straits of Mackinac, he added. Blame an early Passover this year. Next year, it will likely be better for fishing. Passover doesn't start until sunset on April 22, much later in the month. The fish dish is not a religious requirement of the Seder dinner, but don't try telling that to cooks searching for the right ingredients for their classic recipes.

North London's bustling borough of Islington just got a whole lot more colourful thanks to this art installation . Artists have crafted a 3D art project that looks as though the side of a building has been knocked through . The illusory display is a type of artwork known as trompe d'oeil and exposes what looks like a two bedroom household above the revamped Hat & Feathers public house. Anything but a small artistic feat, the entire process took over 160 hours to cover the 1,352 square foot wall, and was created in honour of the UK and Ireland launch of Valspar paint. The thousands of passers-by who frequent the busy street corner each day had to do a double take. The lifelike interiors were brought to life by Poole-based community artist, Nina Camplin, who specialises in large-scale 'trick of the eye' paintings. The project is located on a busy corner on Clerkenwell Road, and attracts the attention of many passers-by . The illusory artwork, painted in trompe d'oeil style, depicts the interiors of a two bedroom family home .

Research shows that, currently, 78 per cent of UK homeowners opt to paint their homes in cream, white or neutral, while a mere 6 per cent of the nation embraces any sort of vivid hues in their interiors. Jane Ryder of Valspar Europe said: 'The reaction from the public so far has been amazing.

The suspects are being questioned over a range of offenses, including arson, rioting, attempted murder and murder, said L.L. Doungal, the police chief of Nagaland, where the attack occurred Thursday evening. They're alleged to be among a crowd of thousands of people who stormed a jail in the Dimapur district, and dragged out the suspected rapist before beating him to death in the street. The 35-year-old victim had been accused of raping a local woman last month. \"There were thousands of them. Many of them were students in uniform,\" Doungal said when news of the attack first emerged. The dead man was initially identified as an undocumented Bangladeshi settler, but now police say they still are determining his nationality. \"I am not ruling out that he's not a Bangladeshi. I am also not denying that he is not an Indian. We are verifying his nationality,\" said G. Akheto Sema, an additional director-general of Nagaland's police, when asked about local reports suggesting the attacked man was an Indian citizen. Dimapur town remains under a curfew, Sema said, amid growing tensions between native Nagas and Bangladeshi migrants in the district. Thousands of protesters demanding the cancellation of trade permits for Bengali-speaking settlers tore into the prison complex Thursday and pulled out the suspect, Doungal said. Police initially used teargas and bamboo canes to rescue the man, but it didn't work, he said. \"There were students in uniform. So, we had to use minimum force,\" Doungal added. Later, police opened fire, but it was too late to save the suspect. Protesters had planned a public hanging, but the suspect died from injuries in the attack, according to authorities. \"We retrieved his body before it could be hung,\" Doungal said. With English as its official language, Nagaland is located in the extreme northeastern end of India, along the border with Myanmar. Home to about two million people, the state is spread over 16,500 square kilometers, with a relatively high literacy rate of 67%, compared with other densely populated parts of India. Ethnic tensions are rife in Nagaland and other provinces of the impoverished northeast region.

The ruling made public Wednesday upheld a lower court ruling that dismissed his lawsuit. The man - identified in court papers as Hiram Jimenez - claimed a waitress didn't warn him the dish was hot. The lower court, however, found that the food posed an 'open and obvious' danger. Ruling: A New Jersey appellate court says a man cannot seek damages from Applebee's for burns he suffered while bowing his head in prayer over a sizzling steak fajita skillet at a restaurant . The incident happened in March 2010 at an Applebee's restaurant in Westampton, New Jersey. Jimenez said he bowed his head, then heard a loud sizzle followed by a grease pop. He then felt a burning sensation in his left eye and on his face. Jimenez said he panicked and knocked the food on his lap, causing more burns. The burns didn't cause scarring. The appellate court ruling said 'Plaintiff alleged that, on March 4, 2010, while a business invitee at Applebee's, he was injured solely as a result of defendants' negligence when he came in contact with a dangerous and hazardous condition, specifically, \"a plate of hot food.\"' 'Here, the danger posed by a plate of sizzling hot food was self-evident,' the ruling said. 'Therefore, we conclude that the motion judge correctly determined that defendants had no duty to warn plaintiff that the food was sizzling hot and should be approached with due care.'

With his team leading La Liga and on the verge of reaching the Champions League quarter-finals at the expense of Manchester City, Pique took time away from training to interact with his fans. When asked who were the best defenders he has played alongside, the 28-year-old listed a pair of stalwarts from the two clubs he has signed for during his career: Carles Puyol at Barcelona and Rio Ferdinand of Manchester United. Barcelona defender Gerard Pique opened up during a Facebook Q&A session with fans . The Spain international scores a rare goal during the 6-1 defeat of Rayo Vallecano on March 8 . Pique picked former Man United team-mate Rio Ferdinand as one of the best defenders he has played with . A young Pique listens as Ferdinand gives youngsters advice during their time together at Old Trafford . Pique arrived at Manchester United from Barcelona's La Masia academy as a teenager in 2004 before returning to Barcelona four years later when opportunities at Old Trafford became limited, primarily because of the established form of Ferdinand and Nemanja Vidic. The Spaniard, who has a child with pop songstress Shakira, bears a similar cultured style to Ferdinand in the mould of a tall defender with excellent technique who is comfortable on the ball. Meanwhile, at the other end of the pitch, Pique again chose one player from England and another from Spain when asked who have been his toughest opponents. Pique picked Real Madrid rival Cristiano Ronaldo (right) as one of the toughest players he's played against . Chelsea battering ram Didier Drogba (2nd left) was another opponent that has tested Pique to the limit . 'Cristiano Roanldo and Didier Drogba,' he answered in reference to his Real Madrid rival and and Chelsea's physically imposing centre-forward. Among other revelations from Pique's Q&A session are that Hristo Stoichkov and Ronald Koeman were his idols as a child while, unsurprisingly, Lionel Messi is 'definitely' the best player he has ever played with. Pique also admitted he misses the presence of Puyol and close friend Cesc Fabregas in the Nou Camp dressing room, saying:  'Yes, a loooooot! Who wouldn't?'

And residents of Gravesend, next to the mouth of the famous waterway, feared they had stumbled upon another gruesome find this morning when this apparent skeleton turned up on the muddy banks. With two bone-like sticks appearing to be bent at the knees lying below seeming ribs and a skull, morning walkers thought they had come across the watery grave of a long-lost soul. This gruesome-looking object was found apparently washed up on the banks of the  Thames this morning . But as they approached the object, which was lying beneath the town's pier, witnesses realised the supposed skeleton was just an optical illusion. Photographer Rob Powell, who was at the pier taking pictures of a ship for  website OnTheThames.net, said: 'I had to double take at first as it's not the kind of thing you usually see by the riverside. 'Obviously, it looked like a skeleton, which was a bit grim, and it was only when I got closer that I realised it was metal and old rope.' The objects became the talk of the town after Mr Powell posted a photo on Twitter. Gravesend town centre manager Graham Long tweeted: 'We've not seen anything like that before - how bizarre and intruiging.' And the town's RNLI spokesman Alan Carr said the find looked 'very sinister'. The object, spotted beneath a pier, turned out to be rope and metal poles which look like a skeleton . As well as a reported 50 corpses a year, the Thames has given up a series of mysterious objects over the river's long history. In 1857, the 4th century BC 'Battersea Shield' was discovered during dredging for the Chelsea Bridge, and is now seen as one the UK's most significant pieces of Celtic ancient art. Prehistoric animal remains have also been discovered on the riverbed and banks, including the tooth of a 28-metre-long Megalodon shark thought to be 1.5 million years old, and a section from the skull of a 30,000-year-old woolly rhino. In 2013, river-users thought they has spotted an alligator living in the river - but it turned out to be a lost prop from the film set of James Bond film Live and Let Die, which had been washed away from its owner's garden.

Parking charges at a popular British seaside resort could soon be weather dependent after a council pledged to halve them when it rains. Councillors in Brighton and Hove say they want to end 'rip-off' charges and are suggesting motorists pay 'significantly less' for street parking on rainy summer days. The scheme, which would be the first of its kind in the UK, is modeled on flexible parking charges schemes in San Francisco and Madrid. It forms part of the Conservative Party manifesto for the May 7 council elections promising, 'A common sense council for Brighton and Hove'. It says: 'We will examine flexible parking charges and the innovative use of technology e.g. introduce significantly cheaper charges in winter, on rainy summer days etc. 'It is bizarre that summer parking rates begin on 1 March.Under the Conservatives summer parking charges will only apply in summer.' But critics have hailed it as an early April Fools' Day joke, given the fickle British summertime weather. Conservative transport spokesman Graham Cox, told The Telegraph the economy relied on the weather and they had to look at ways of attracting people when it was bad. 'If it's a lovely, hot, summer day in June, July or August, the queues in Brighton will stretch up the A23 and every space in town is taken. If it's wet, it's a very different situation,' he said. Every cloud: Conservative councillors in Brighton and Hove are promising to halve the cost of parking on rainy days in summer in a bid to boost tourist numbers . In 2013, business leaders blamed parking charges and poor weather for the plummeting number of visitors to the region during a particularly wet summer. Figures from the Brighton Business Improvement District (BID) showed footfall in the city had dropped by 14 per cent year-on-year. Costly sunshine: Visitors would be charged twice as much to park on sunny days under new proposals by councillors in Brighton . The parking proposal would be based on weather forecasts so if heavy downpours were predicted for a particular weekend, the parking tariffs would be reduced. Motoring organisations said it would confuse drivers and said both tariffs and clear instructions would need putting on street parking signs.", "completion": "response:\n\n'Significantly cheaper' charges promised during rainy summer days .\nThe cut rate aims to boost falling visitor numbers to resort when its wet .\nCritics call it an early April Fools' Day prank that will confuse motorists ."}

The men were having dinner on Friday night in the western city of Wakayama when they ate puffer fish liver, which prompted vomiting and breathing difficulties early the next morning. Puffer fish - also called blowfish or fugu in Japanese - are the world's most toxic group of fish and their livers, ovaries and skin contain tetrodotoxin, 100 times more lethal than cyanide. Dicing with death: Five Japanese men were poisoned after eating banned parts of the puffer fish (file photo) Yet eating the fish's flesh is a tradition in Japan, where wealthy diners play the Russian roulette of the restaurant world by dining on sashimi slivers so thin they are almost transparent. According to a city health official, the men asked to eat a banned, toxic part of the fish - which the most foolhardy fugu aficionados are said to enjoy for the tingling it produces on the lips. Popular: The tradition of eating thin slices of 'fugu' persists despite dozens of poisonings a year . The tingling is only the first symptom of tetrodotoxin poisoning, and is seen as part of the thrill for lovers of the fish. But if the toxin is served in any significant quantity it then paralyses the muscles, suffocating victims as it reaches their chests and diaphragms while they are still conscious. The health official said the men were in their 40s and 50s and the restaurant was shut down for five days from yesterday amid an investigation. 'They consumed a dinner that included liver, which is regarded as toxic material,' she told AFP, reading from a statement. Calls to the restaurant went unanswered. Chefs who want to serve puffer fish must train for two years before taking a rigorous test which a third of applicants fail. The most prized species is the tiger puffer, takifugu rubripes, whose flesh is safe to eat but whose liver, ovaries and intestine can all kill. It is not clear which species of puffer fish the men ate. Puffer fish account for the majority of Japan's food poisoning deaths but the delicacy shows no sign of dying out, although it is heavily regulated. Government figures show 30 to 50 people are hospitalised every year, with a few of those cases leading to death.", "completion": "response:\n\nMen in their 40s and 50s ate at restaurant in Wakayama, Japan, on Friday .\nThey fell ill the next morning with breathing difficulties and vomiting .\nHealth official claimed they asked to eat highly poisonous fish's liver .\nRestaurant has been shut down for five days as investigation continues .\nPuffer fish toxins kill - but aficionados eat just enough for tingling on lips ."}

The 52-year-old man's body has been moved to a local hospital after the attack yesterday. Scroll down for video . A shark attacked and killed a 52-year-old German tourist off Al-Qusayr in Egypt (library photo) Officials are conducting an investigation into the attack, which saw the man's leg bitten off at the knee. State news agency Al-Ahram report that the tourist was swimming with his wife when the attack happened. An official from the German Embassy in Cairo says they received reports that a German citizen died in the area but are not aware of the cause of death. It was the first fatal shark attack in Egypt since a string of maulings in 2010 that left a German woman dead and three Russian tourists wounded in another Red Sea resort. The attack happened just off Al-Qusayr, at a popular spot for tourists swimming . The shark attack is the first reported incident in five years, since one German woman was killed back in 2010 . In 2010, the German pensioner was mauled to death as she snorkelled in relatively shallow waters around the resort, which is famed for its scuba diving sites. She died just a day after Egyptian authorities lifted a 48-hour ban prompted by four other savage shark attacks. One victim lost a hand and another lost a leg. The Red Sea is home to several species of shark, but the type believed to have been behind the 2010 attacks was the oceanic whitetip common to the region.

Lorie Wosmek is suing The McDowell Agency and her local district after she was let go as a school's volunteer and made to feel a social pariah. The mother-of-two said that her life changed for the worse in the fall of 2012 when she agreed to a background check after years helping out  at Remer School District, even coaching one of their football teams. Fired: Lorie Wosmek was not allowed to volunteer at Remer School District because a wrong background check identified her as a murderer . 'Parents acted strange,' said Wosmek to CBS. 'People who said 'hi' to me before wouldn't say 'hi' anymore. Wosmek was suddenly told she could no longer work around children and the district said that they would let her know why she was being dumped in a letter. It arrived with a copy of her background check which showed up a woman with the same name, but wildly different past. 'All I saw on there was homicide,' said Wosmek. I burst into tears. False: This is the background check returned on Lorie Wosmek that ruined her life as a volunteer . Help: Wosmek once worked as a coach in the Remer School District and enjoyed her time as a volunteer . According to the wrong background check, Wosmek was supposed to have committed vehicular homicide. However, Wosmek had never committed or been convicted of this crime and tried to tell the district and the background check company,. She alleges the false check was passed around other school district's in the area for five months - which stopped her getting more work. The district denies this allegation. Denials: The Remer School District has said that it does not recognize any of Lorie Wosmek's claims . Wosmek says despite the error being recognized she has not been welcomed back. Again, the district denies not offering her more work as a volunteer. 'When people hear good news like 'she didn't commit the crime,' they don't tend to spread that around,' said Wosmek to CBS. The McDowell Agency, which is in St. Paul has admitted in court filings that their check was a mistake. A spokesperson told CBS, 'We believe the evidence will support our position that Ms. Wosmek's reputation was not impacted or harmed by anything we did.'", "completion": "response:\n\nLorie Wosmek is suing the Remer School District in Minnesota .\nClaims she was fired from volunteering in 2012 after the check .\nAlleges that afterwards she became a social pariah and could not work ."}

He also criticized a letter sent by 47 U.S. Republican senators to Iran's leaders, which threatened to scupper any deal if a Republican President is elected next year, Iran's official Press TV reported. \"Of course, I'm concerned because the other side is into deception, trickery and backstabbing,\" Khamenei is quoted as saying in a speech in Tehran. He suggested that the letter was part of a U.S. strategy of last-minute reversal aimed at undermining a comprehensive deal covering Iran's nuclear ambitions, Press TV said. \"This is part of their ploys and tricks,\" said Khamenei. Iran faces a March 24 deadline to reach a deal over its nuclear program. Several interim agreements have been made in recent months, though a long-term pact so far has been elusive. The six world powers -- the United States, Russia, China, the United Kingdom and France, plus Germany, a group known as the P5+1 -- are seeking a deal that will ensure that Iran doesn't develop nuclear arms. Officials in Tehran have publicly insisted they want a nuclear program for energy purposes, not to create atomic weaponry. The Republican senators' decision to write to Iran's leaders has stirred up a political firestorm in the United States. U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry denounced the letter Wednesday at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing, calling it a breach of \"more than two centuries of precedent\" and factually incorrect. Did 47 Republican senators break the law in plain sight? \"It purports to tell the world that if you want to have any confidence in your dealings with America, they have to negotiate with 535 members of Congress,\" Kerry said. \"That is both untrue and a profoundly bad suggestion to make.\" Sen. Tom Cotton, a freshman Republican from Arkansas, penned the letter, which asserted that a lasting agreement would need congressional support. He wasn't shy about his attempts to undermine the Obama administration's negotiations with Iran and said Tuesday that the letter is \"about stopping Iran from getting a nuclear deal.\" Hillary Clinton blasts Cotton Iran letter .

Sir Michael Wilshaw, chief inspector of schools and children’s services, said saving youngsters from exploitation required ‘political and moral courage’ on the part of local leaders. ‘They must never allow misguided beliefs about the impact for certain ethnic and cultural groups to get in the way of confronting this horrific abuse wherever it occurs,’ he added. His warning came amid the row over the failure of social workers, politicians or police to act against gangs of mostly Pakistani men who exploited hundreds of children in Rotherham and Oxford. An inquiry last month said Rotherham councillors shied away from the issue for fear of being accused of disturbing ‘community cohesion’. It added: ‘By failing to take action against the Pakistani heritage male perpetrators of child sexual exploitation in the borough, the council has inadvertently fuelled the far-Right.’ Last week an inquiry into a similar scandal in Oxford, carried out by the head of the local safeguarding board, said there was ‘no evidence of any agency not acting when they should have done because of racial sensitivities’. But the Thames Valley Police and Crime Commissioner accused it of ‘pulling its punches’. Sir Michael’s warning was contained in an Ofsted report that found most local councils charged with looking after children’s safety are failing at the job. Only ten out of 43 inspected over the course of a year were found to give a good standard of care and protection. Criticised: Rotherham's director of children's services between 2008 and 2014 Joyce Thacker (left) and former Rotherham Council leader Roger Stone (right) were both criticised for their inaction over the scandal . Sir Michael said youngsters who go missing from children’s homes while in council care are disproportionately at risk of abuse but social workers in some areas still fail to take notice of them. He added: ‘We found children and young people who had been missing were either not having an interview on their return or having one that was of poor quality.

It was, undoubtedly, a brilliant piece of play from the Brazilian, but immediately the inquest began as to how Chelsea had allowed the centre back so much space.

Peters stopped, ran past a woman making futile attempts to pat out the fire and tackled the burning man into an icy snowbank, using handfuls of dirty snow to douse the flames. Peters and two other motorists were credited with saving the life of 84-year-old Christopher Flowers after his clothing caught fire from a cigarette he was smoking while driving on Monday morning. Police and fire officials in the town of Gates said Tuesday that Flowers, of Chili, was driving when the multiple shirts he was wearing caught fire from a dropped lit cigarette. Flowers pulled over and got out of his car as flames spread across his clothing. Officials say three passing motorists — Peters and two women — pulled over to help. Peters said one of the women was trying to knock down the flames with her hands, but wasn't having any success. 'I scooped the guy up and did an end-zone dive into the snowbank,' Peters told The Associated Press. Peters said Flowers was wearing several layers of clothing, including two or three flannel shirts and a couple T-Shirts topped by a hooded sweatshirt. The three rescuers removed the smoldering clothing and wrapped him in a blanket that one of the women had in her trunk.

The Bangladeshi woman, who cannot be named, served five years for attempted murder in 2009 after she attacked her daughter in the midst of a marital breakdown. On her release, a tribunal decided not to deport her – as is usually the case with foreign criminals – so she could still see the child. The Bangladeshi woman, from Tower Hamlets, east London, who served five years for attempted murder in 2009, has been allowed to remain in the UK after the Court of Appeal ruled it was a 'truly exceptional’ case . The Government appealed but the woman, of Tower Hamlets, East London, was yesterday granted leave to remain. Court of Appeal judge Lord Justice Pitchford said the case was ‘truly exceptional’. He said: 'The circumstances of the offence, the bitter suffering of [the mother] following the offence and the clear benefit to the victim of the offence of continued face to face contact with her mother rendered this case truly exceptional. 'In short, despite the generic public interest in deportation of foreign criminals, there was no public interest in further punishing the victim of the crime. 'In my view, the combined circumstances of the crime and its consequences were exceptional and the First-Tier Tribunal was entitled to conclude that separation, which was likely to be permanent, would be cruel both to the offender and to the victim.' The judge heard the appeal with Lord Justice Sullivan and Lady Justice King, who both agreed with the decision.

The video contrasts the murders of the eight men, all blindfolded dressed in red jumpsuits, cut with footage of people who apparently have been killed or badly injured in coalition attacks on ISIS-held locations. The men are accused of being informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS. Scroll down for video . Murdered: Militants claim the eight men were informers, engaged in military operations against ISIS . The slickly edited video - which appears to take inspiration from violent video games, complete with sickening 'player profiles' of each of the doomed men - is thought to have been shot in the Euprhates, which covers Syria and Iraq. The men, who are both Iraqi and Syrian, are led by their murderers out of a van onto a derelict piece of land, where they are forced to kneel in a row. The captors, armed with what look like meat cleavers, stand behind their victims. Behind them, the buildings appear to have been reduced to rubble. Interspersed with the footage of the prisoners is footage of a dead child under the rubble and in a body bag, and a dead man at the hospital, who appears to have been shot. The makers of the video seem to want to point the finger of blame for their latest horrendous actions at the coalition forces' campaign against ISIS. Revenge: The militants have justified the killings as retaliation for air strikes against land they hold . To make that clear, the video begins with a mock-up of a coalition airstrike, complete with a fake jet seemingly piloted by someone with an American accent. ‘By God we will get our revenge,’ the video states. This new video has been released just days after another ISIS production, which claimed to show a young boy executing an alleged Israeli-Arab spy. At about the same time, militants fighting for the Islamic State have released a video claiming to show the execution of two Libyan soldiers. The militants have turned to brutal videos like these as a form of propaganda, apparently simultaneously hoping to attract new fighters and spread fear among those working against ISIS.", "completion": "response:\n\nVideo shows murders of eight men allegedly working against Islamic State .\nInterspersed with footage of child and man 'killed by coalition forces'\nIncludes sickening video game-like 'player profiles' of each doomed man .\n‘By God we will get our revenge,’ slickly edited video states at one point ."}

He made the claims when asked in an interview about the Florida project's clunky name - The Woods Jupiter: Sports and Dining Club. Tiger Woods is unable to name his restaurant after himself because Nike owns the rights to his name, the project developer has claimed .

It is wholly inaccurate and categorically false', golfchannel.com reported. 'Tiger owns his own name and always had.' A Nike spokesperson supported this, denying the corporation owned the rights to the name Tiger Woods. Developer Allied Capital and Development of South Florida previously said the property is expected to be a 5,900-square-foot restaurant, likely to open in early 2015.

The Russian President had been due to make a visit to Kazakhstan this week but an official there said it had been cancelled because he was ill. Mr Putin also failed to appear at an annual meeting of high-ranking officers from the Federal Security Service today, an event he has attended in past years. Scroll down for video . Last public appearance: Vladimir Putin with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi in Russia last week . It was claimed the crisis over Ukraine and murder of an opposition politician may have caused a collapse in Mr Putin's health. But another theory, advanced by the lawyer of murdered Boris Nemtsov, was that the strongman may be lying low because he is 'afraid' of an assassination bid. Rumours: The Ukraine crisis may have contributed to a collapse in Putin's health, it has been claimed . Putin loves to be seen as an ever-present action man, but the Russian president has been absent from public view for a week. The 62 year old's unusual absence has dented his tough-guy image. His aides scrambled to explain he was healthy and his macho handshake remained so strong 'it breaks your hand'. Putin was last seen in public when he met with Italian Prime Minister Matteo Renzi on 5 March. Official pictures have emerged of meetings since then, but rumours say these in fact took place earlier before his sudden and unexplained disappearance. Nemtsov's lawyer claimed Putin may be scared over the high profile murder yards from the Kremlin, suggesting the Russian leader maybe in hiding fearing an assassination bid. 'Perhaps Putin, even completely sincerely, was bewildered and even afraid,' said Vadim Prokhorov. 'Because if you can do that next to the Kremlin, then is it not possible to do it along the route of the presidential motorcade?' Spokesman Dmitry Peskov dismissed the health speculation over Putin as 'spring fever'. The leader was 'holding meetings all the time' to solve the 'crisis'. 'There is no need to worry. Everything is fine,' said Peskov, not explaining why Putin did not make an appearance to disarm the rumour-mongers. The spate of speculation over his condition recalled regular health scares over his predecessor Boris Yeltsin, and a clutch of geriatric Soviet leaders.", "completion": "response:\n\nPutin's visit to Kazakhstan was cancelled because he was ill, official said .\nHe also failed to appear at annual meeting of high-ranking officers today .\nClaimed Ukraine crisis may have contributed to collapse in his health .\nPresident was last seen in public when he met with Italian PM last week ."}

But as Australia and New Zealand go head-to-head in the World Cup final at the Melbourne Cricket Ground on Sunday, the underarm bowling incident from 1981 will inevitably come back to haunt. The  controversial bowl triggered a cold war between the two nations after the infamous day  on February 1 when New Zealand needed six runs with one ball remaining to draw the match. But Aussie skipper Greg Chappell instructed the bowler, who was his younger brother Trevor, to deliver the ball underarm in a bid to prevent batsman Brian McKechnie any chance of hitting a six. Scroll down for video . It was a single bowl that triggered a massive uproar at the time when Aussie bowler delivered an underarm . As the ball gently rolled down the pitch, McKechnie blocked the ball before he tossed his bat to the ground out of anger and disgust. Australia went on to win the match but the hell that followed left the Chappell brothers struggling to cope under the pressure from the backlash. Despite the underarm bowling was not ruled as illegal at the time, it was deemed 'an act of cowardice' and against the true spirit of cricket that cost New Zealand the tournament. Aussie bowler Trevor Chappell, right, bowls underarm to New Zealand batsman Brian McKechnie on the last ball of a one-day international from which New Zealand needed to hit six runs to force a tie . Trevor Chappell bowls under-arm, as ordered by brother Greg at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in 1981 . But Black Caps fast bowler Tim Southee, who was two-years-old at the time of the underarm incident, said the infamous bowl is rarely mentioned. 'I guess a few of us were too young to remember seeing it but we know it happened,' Southee said at a conference on Friday. 'I haven’t heard too much about the underarm.' While New Zealand prepares ahead of their first ever World Cup final on Sunday, Aussie skipper Michael Clarke has announced his retirement from one-day cricket on the eve of the match.

The letter was taken by Tories as a campaign against the market economy, consumerism and the legacy of Margaret Thatcher. The new study guide from the Church’s Mission and Public Affairs Division underlined the call for consideration of ‘relationships among the nations of Europe who share a long history moulded by the Christian faith’. It repeated demands for ‘a fresh debate’ on nuclear weapons, and said those who care about tackling debt should also care ‘about the burdens borne by the most vulnerable in society’. Two prayers were offered: in one worshippers were asked to pray to ‘help us turn our backs on self-interest and to support policies that sustain the poor, the vulnerable and the frightened people of this world’. A second prayer calls for protection ‘from the sins of despair and cynicism’ and ‘the idols of false utopias’. A source close to Mr Duncan Smith said: ‘It is truly bizarre that they are praying to sustain people in poverty. Surely the aim should be to support people to lift themselves out of poverty?

United are fourth in the table just two points behind second-placed Manchester City. They face their neighbours and defending champions on April 12 during a crucial four game spell that sees them take on Aston Villa, Chelsea and Everton. However, the manner of their victories against Tottenham and Liverpool in recent weeks has been ominous. Bryan Robson has hailed Ander Herrera as one of the key figures in Manchester United's revival this year . Herrera celebrates after scoring the opening goal during their FA Cup third round match with Yeovil Town . Former United captain Robson recognises that Juan Mata has been winning the bulk of the plaudits but admires the qualities Herrera is showing. 'Ander started off the season well and he’s got a lot of energy,' Robson told ManUtd.com. 'He is always on the move, trying to close people down really quickly. He has got a lot of qualities really, it’s just getting them out of him on a consistent basis. But he has got that in his locker, maybe it’s just taken him and a few of the new signings time to adapt to the Premier League.' Herrera set up Mata's first goal against Liverpool with an inch-perfect pass and the 25-year-old acquisition from Athletic Bilbao has shown signs of being able to provide a greater tempo to United's play. 'He is quite good defensively and, when I watch him, I can see he has a lot of energy and he does like to get involved' added Robson. 'What I like about him is that, when people are on the ball, he is always on the move to try and receive the pass.'

Nearly one in ten in the same age group are worried that they are addicted to porn, a survey of nearly 700 children for the NSPCC's ChildLine service found. And nearly a fifth said they had seen porn images that had shocked or upset them. Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about pornography. She said: 'Young people are turning to the internet to learn about sex and relationships. 'We know they are frequently stumbling across porn, often unintentionally, and they are telling us very clearly that this is having a damaging and upsetting effect on them. 'Girls in particular have said they feel like they have to look and behave like porn stars to be liked by boys. 'We absolutely have to talk to young people about sex, love, respect and consent as soon as we feel they are ready, to ensure that they gain a proper perspective between real life relationships and the fantasy world of porn.' Peter Liver, director of ChildLine, said children reported that watching porn made them feel depressed, gave them body image issues and put pressure on them to engage in sex acts they are not ready for. A report by charity ChildWise in 2013/14 revealed that website Pornhub was among the top five favourite sites named by boys aged 11-16. Dame Esther Rantzen, the founder of ChildLine, said children as young as 11 had contacted the service with concerns about pornography . And young people post approximately 18,000 messages regarding exposure to porn on the ChildLine discussion forums every month. Mr Liver said: 'The Government recently proposed plans for children aged 11 upwards to be taught about rape and sexual consent as part of PSHE in schools. 'This would include discussion around what they have learnt from watching pornography. 'Across society, we need to remove the embarrassment and shame that exists around talking about porn - which is why we have launched a ChildLine campaign to help young people to make more informed choices.'", "completion": "response:\n\nChildren aged 12 and 13 say they have been in sexually explicit videos .\nNearly one in ten say they are worried that they are addicted to porn .\nNearly a fifth were shocked or upset by porn, NSPCC's ChildLine found ."}

'I know my daughter and she is not one to make up stories or lie, so eventually I took her to see a dentist.' There, Ana, from the Brazilian capital, Brasilia, was diagnosed with a rare form of oral myiasis. This is a fly lava maggot infection that grows in humans and animals. 'I couldn't believe it when they said she had a disease and then started pulling the maggots out,' said Ms Cardoso. 'I thought I was going to be sick.'

'We also wanted to show the girl's family what had happened and warn others.' The video shows Ana's reaction as a surgeon in white gloves takes out one maggot at a time with a pair of tweezers. Ms Cardoso said: 'She was actually very calm throughout the whole process but I suspect that was more out of helplessness. 'I mean, what else could she do?' Myiasis comes from the Latin word 'myia' meaning fly and 'iasis' means disease. The flies' larvae can feed on the host's living or dead tissue, liquid body substance, or ingested food. When the tissues in the oral cavity are invaded by parasites, this is known as oral myiasis. Those at risk of the rare condition include those from poorer social backgrounds and people who have suffered wounds or other injury to the face. It is also more common in regions with a warmer climate. Infestations of the nose and ears are dangerous because of the possibility of penetration into the brain, the fatality rate is 8 per cent in such cases.", "completion": "response:\n\nAna Cardoso, 10, had been taken to the clinic in Brazil's capital, Brasilia .\nHad complained of tingling sensation in gums and things 'moving around'\nDentist was shocked to discover fly lava maggot infection inside her gums .\nCalled oral myiasis, it had caused 15 maggots to form in her mouth ."}

But flying an Ebola patient halfway around the world -- while keeping that person alive, and everyone safe -- is complicated. Probably no one knows that better than Phoenix Air, a Georgia-based company that is the go-to for transporting Ebola victims by air. Since August, it has made approximately 40 trips -- about half to Europe, the rest to the United States. \"We're like a fire truck sitting in the firehouse. The bell goes off and within a matter of hours we can be out the door and underway,\" said Dent Thompson, vice president and chief operations officer at Phoenix Air. He described the system that goes inside the company's modified Gulfstream G-III aircraft. It consists of three major elements: . Once the plane has landed and the patient has left, the whole system is sealed. The aircraft then flies to a high-security hanger in Cartersville, Georgia, where it undergoes a complete decontamination process, which can take up to 24 hours. Everything inside the liner, including the liner, is sterilized multiple times. The liner and everything in it is then removed, put in special boxes, and taken to a federally licensed incinerator where everything is destroyed. \"We like to say it's more sterile than the surface of the moon when we're done with it,\" Thompson said. Phoenix Air began developing its system way before the current Ebola outbreak. It worked with the Department of Defense and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to build a system that could safety transport patients with contagious diseases. Then, the main concerns were SARS, swine and bird flu. It took years to work out the kinks and get the system approved, and by the time the work was done, the need had sort of petered out. But Thompson said Phoenix Air held onto the system, knowing -- unfortunately -- the need would arise again. He got a call from the State Department in July. By August, the company had completed its first Ebola flight, safely delivering Dr. Kent Brantly to Emory University Hospital in Atlanta. A few days later, it brought Nancy Writebol to the same hospital for treatment. And on and on and on. Thompson said other groups are now developing systems similar to Phoenix Air's, including the U.S. government. But so far, none has flown. \"Other organizations have built systems, but we're the ones still doing it,\" he said. More than 10,000 people have died in the Ebola outbreak, mostly in the countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone.", "completion": "response:\n\nGeorgia company equips plane to transport Ebola patients .\nDesign was developed when SARS, swine and bird flu were generating concern ."}

It's not as easy when it comes to health care. The truth is that undergoing a simple tonsillectomy can cost as little as $4,000 to as much as $14,000, depending on the city, according to new data compiled by Gawker. Using data from HealthSparq, the website charted eight common procedures and compared how much they cost in Washington, DC; New York City; Miami; Houston; Los Angeles and San Francisco. Random: New data shows the difference in price for common health care procedures in six cities across the U.S. Above, the cost of undergoing a tonsillectomy varies as much as $10,000 . Common procedure: The cost of undergoing an appendectomy hovers around $14,000 in most cities, but is a steal in Washington DC at $9,000 . The results will certainly have Houston residents driving to Los Angeles if they want to undergo a carpal tunnel procedure. A carpal tunnel release procedure at a surgical center in Houston costs upwards of $20,000 - while the price of the same procedure in the other cities hover between $5,000 and $8,000. Herniated disc decompression surgery costs $15,000 in Washington and more than three and a half times more in Houston and Los Angeles - more than $48,000. A simply tonsillectomy will run $3,500 in Washington - but costs $14,000 in San Francisco. The reason health care costs are not widely advertised stems from the fact that they vary based on who ends up paying - and insurers don't like revealing the negotiated final amount. However, there has been a recent push towards price transparency. Some states have  started making databses of health care costs based on insurance claims and other insurance data. You can also research the costs of health care further on websites like HealthcareBlueBook.com. Ouch: Decompressing a herniated disc at a surgical center in Houston, Los Angeles, San Francisco and New York costs around the same as four years of college . Astronomical: Houston has an exceptionally high cost for a carpal tunnel release at a surgical center compared to the rest of the cities . Simple: It costs about twice the amount to undergo a outpatient carpal tunnel procedure in Miami than it does in New York City .", "completion": "response:\n\nCharts show differences in price for common medical procedure in six U.S. cities .\nPrices for a procedure like a tonsillectomy can range between $4,000 and $14,000 ."}

Ministers say allowing online shoppers to pick up their purchases at local shops, rather than have them delivered at home, will give a boost to the high street. Retailers will no longer have to apply for planning permission – which costs £195 per application– and fill in reams of paperwork before being allowed to offer the service from April 15. Online boost: All shops in the UK will be allowed to offer ‘click and collect’ services for people to collect their parcels from next month . The UK is the biggest user of ‘click and collect’ services in the world - and use is expected to double in the next three years. But planning minister Brandon Lewis said high streets do not have to lose out, because online shopping can bring people into town centres. Many people who are at work all day - and know they will miss the postman – can choose to have parcels delivered to their local shop where they can collect them at a convenient time. Mr Lewis said: ‘Far from threatening the high street, online shopping offers a new opportunity. How we shop is changing radically and I want to help our high streets thrive from online competition. Ministers say allowing online shoppers to collect at local shops will give a boost to the high street . ‘These measures will mean even more retailers can offer ‘click and collect’ services, encouraging shoppers to visit their businesses and pick up their purchases at a time that suits them.’ There was a boom in Christmas shopping via click and collect this year – with John Lewis saying half its customers picked up parcels in store rather than having them posted to their homes in December. Supermarkets and department stores are already using the service, and some allow ebay and Amazon customers to pick up their purchases instore.

After the Lions declined to use the franchise tag on Suh to save $26.5m of cap space, the Dolphins look to have beaten Oakland, Jacksonville, Indianapolis and San Diego to the most coveted signature in this year’s free agency. Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million, six-year deal with around $60m guaranteed, ESPN report. With no state taxes in Florida, the deal dwarfs JJ Watt’s current six-year, $100m deal which the Texans’ defensive end penned last year. Ndamukong Suh will on Tuesday sign a $114million with the Miami Dolphins with $60million guaranteed . Suh, the second pick of the 2010 draft, is a four time Pro-Bowler and three-time first team All-Pro and led the Lions with 8.5 sacks last season. At 28, Suh is in his prime and is a once-in-a decade type of player whom the Dolphins can build their franchise around. A fearsome pass rusher, he was the cornerstone of NFL’s best rushing defense and helped the Lions to the play-offs last year. He will join the likes of Cameron Wake and Oliver Vernon in an aggressive front four. In his five years in Detroit, Suh played 80 out of 82 games. He was suspended for both of those for stamping on Evan Dietrich-Smith of the Green Bay Packers in 2011. Veterans such as Cortland Finnegan (right) were among those released by the Dolphins to free up cap space . Following his exit, the focus for the Lions front office will be getting fellow defensive tackle Nick Fairley to stay. After declining his fifth-year option last year due to injury concerns, the 26-year-old is considered the second-best free agent defensive tackle. Should Suh depart, which appears likely, they will need a run-stuffer alongside him. The free-spending Dolphins had a roster clear-out which paved the way for Suh’s arrival.

Governor Scott Walker once envisioned a world where the 11 million immigrants living in the country illegally could embark on a path to citizenship. But now the Wisconsin Republican calls that position 'amnesty' and says his view has changed. 'I don't believe in amnesty,' Walker told Fox News Sunday. 'My view has changed. I'm flat out saying it. Candidates can say that.' Walker, who emerged this past week in the top tier of potential candidates for the Republican presidential nomination for 2016, says the U.S. needs to secure the border and ultimately put in place 'a legal immigration system that works.' That means, in part, putting the onus on employers and getting them the tools to do that, like E-Verify, an existing federal program that allows businesses to check the immigration status of new hires, Walker said. Walker told the Wausau, Wisconsin, Daily Herald newspaper in 2013 that 'it makes sense' when he was asked whether he could see a world where 'those people' could get citizenship, with the right penalties, waiting periods and requirements in place. At the time, he supported a bipartisan approach to overhauling immigration, with people waiting to get citizenship having priority and others having a legal pathway to live here legally. Walker also said Sunday that President Barack Obama or 'anybody else who is willing to put their name on the ballot certainly has to have the love for country to do that.' Walker drew criticism last month after former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani questioned Obama's patriotism during a speech at a Walker fundraiser.  When asked about the former mayor's comments, Walker sidestepped the question by saying he hadn't asked Obama about his love of country.", "completion": "response:\n\nWisconsin governor once favored plan whereby undocumented people could become US citizens .\nBut admitted in interview on Sunday that 'my view has changed'\nChange of heart follows Obama's controversial executive action on issue ."}

The non-invasive IONA test examines DNA in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders. It will be offered at in London through the NHS and privately. The non-invasive IONA test examines DNA in cells from the foetus found floating in the mother’s blood and looks for evidence of chromosomal abnormalities that cause genetic disorders . Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad for processing. It is one of several non-invasive prenatal testing (NIPT) examinations that promise greater accuracy for women at high risk of having a Down’s baby. Eventually such NIPT tests will be routinely used to reassure all pregnant women. Current screening for Down’s on the NHS consists of the less-accurate ‘combined’ test, which uses ultrasound to measure the amount of fluid at the back of the baby’s neck at 11 weeks, as well as a blood test. Professor Basky Thilaganathan, consultant obstetrician at St George’s, said the new test was the first to be regulated under the EU’s health and safety standards. He said: ‘Too many pregnant women have been through the anxiety and discomfort of invasive procedures after receiving false positive results [women wrongly identified as being at risk] from the combined test – the IONA test gives us the accuracy and reliability to reduce this number significantly.’ Results will be given within days – compared to the two weeks it takes to send comparable tests abroad . A study by the UK National Screening Committee to check whether NIPT should be offered routinely on the NHS is underway, involving five hospitals, and is due to report later this year. Trials of another NIPT test offering expectant mothers 99 per cent accuracy in screening for Down’s syndrome are being run by Great Ormond Street Hospital. NIPT has a higher detection rate and lower false positive rate than the combined test. This means fewer women will undergo unnecessary invasive follow-up procedures which are stressful and carry a small risk of miscarriage. Dr Stephen Little, CEO of Premaitha – the makers of the IONA test, said: ‘We recognised the limitations in the current standard of prenatal screening and the huge unmet medical need for a regulated test.’", "completion": "response:\n\nNon-invasive IONA test examines foetus DNA in cells in mother's blood .\nResults will be given within days - not like the current wait of weeks .\nTest will be offered at St George's Hospital in London, and privately .\nEventually similar tests will be routinely used to reassure pregnant women ."}

Jimmy Barling said Monday that DNA tests will be done on tissue samples from the three bull calves and the one heifer calf to satisfy those who may question the births from one mother. 'We knew she was pregnant, but we didn't know she was going to do this,' the 76-year-old Barling said. 'This was a shock. This blew our minds.' Awesome foursome: Dora Rumsey-Barling is seen here among newborn calves Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo near DelKalb, Texas, on March 16. It is incredibly rare for a momma cow to birth four calves . Rare: The cow, described by Dora Rumsey-Barling as 'just a run of the mill red cow', had been bred to an Angus bull, so all four of the calves are black . This momma cow has apparently defied great odds and given birth to four calves. DNA tests will be done to satisfy those who question the veracity of the calves . Barling's wife, Dora Rumsey-Barling, owns the couple's 20 or so cattle outside of DeKalb, near the Arkansas and Oklahoma borders. Rumsey-Barling's granddaughter named the four black calves Eeny, Meeny, Miny and Moo, Barling said. Local veterinarian Mike Baird called the March 16 births 'extremely rare.' He said the odds of four live births from one cow are 1 in 11.2 million. Baird knows the couple well and is nearly certain the four came from one mother, rather than a nearby cow perhaps birthing one or two and then moving along so that it appeared the four came from the Barling's cow. 'In the interest of science and the animal world, it's one of those things that need to be verified beyond a shadow of a doubt,' he said. Proud: Jimmy Barling shows off two of his new calves, after one of his cows apparently underwent an extremely rare pregnancy and birth . The couple watched the birth of the fourth calf after going to check on her when they saw buzzards circling above a field. Because the mother cow is unable to nurse all four calves, the couple are relying on neighbors to help. Moo has stayed with her mother, while Eeny, Meeny and Miny are with two different caretakers. Meeny is the smallest of the calves, weighing in at about 25 pounds. A typical healthy birth weight for a calf is 75 pounds.

Child trafficking has been a long-standing problem in China, but despite the efforts of the authorities, the sinister practice is thriving, leading to thousands of families being torn apart. The US State Department believes that 20,000 children are snatched every year – that’s 400 a week. Scroll down for video . As many as 200,000 boys and girls are kidnapped in China every year and sold openly online, it’s been reported . However, Chinese state media says the figure could be as high as 200,000, according to the BBC. Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they’ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as £10,500. In a bid to evade the spotlight of the police, child traffickers in recent years have turned to the internet to do their selling. Last year hundreds of babies were rescued by police in China after a crackdown was launched on trafficking infants. The nationwide bust saw 1,094 people arrested as officers acted on information relating to four major internet-based baby trafficking rings. China's Public Security Ministry said 382 babies were rescued after four websites were found to be selling children under the guise of adoption. Baby boys, who are preferred in China because they’ll ensure the family name remains intact, can sell for as much as £10,500 . Some critics say the trade is fuelled by the country’s one-child policy. The strict laws limit many families to one child, and with boys being favoured as heirs to the family name, many female babies are sold - typically fetching half the amount boys do - aborted or abandoned. Poverty fuels the trade, while illicit profits tempts traffickers, resulting in a thriving market for babies and toddlers. An investigation by the BBC revealed the plight of one father, Xiao Chaohua, who has not seen his son since February 2007 after he disappeared from their home in Huizhou, aged five. Since then Mr Chaohua has scoured the nation and even taken out TV adverts in an effort to find him, but to no avail. He claims that the problem of trafficking can only be eradicated if tougher laws are brought in to punish those to buy kidnapped children. Presently, they face a three-year jail term if caught, but it’s claimed that many never find themselves in trouble over their actions.", "completion": "response:\n\nChild trafficking a long-standing problem in China despite efforts of police .\nSome critics say the trade is fuelled by the country’s one-child policy .\nBoys continue the family name, leading to females being sold off .\nMany babies sold online by traffickers under the guise of adoption ."}

Flam, a cat in Nashville, Tennessee, may well be the first of its kind to have had a conversation with a human being. But sadly, as documented on video, the little chat didn't go down that well with the feline.

Sitting on the floor, she announces to the camera that she is holding a cat-to-human language translator on her phone. Penny, who doesn't herself know what it is being translated by the app, activates the meowing sound and immediately Flam, who sits underneath a table, becomes noticeably intrigued. Penny announces to the camera that she is about to use a cat-to-human translator app on her phone . Jumping up, the feline negotiates a number of dumbbells on the floor before making its way towards Penny. With its tail poised, the cat maintains its eye-contact while lifting its paw and climbing up onto her leg. Suddenly it lashes out at her – opening its mouth to bare its teeth it strikes her with its paw. Intrigued, the cat approaches Penny with its tail poised and begins slowly climbing up her leg . Reacting by blocking the cat with her arm, Penny laughs in surprise as the insulted feline continues to bare its teeth before scuttling off. According to Penny, she had visited Kate Framke's home – Flam’s owner – to photograph her other cat  Waffles for a fundraising calendar for The Cat Shoppe. After struggling to get Waffles’ attention with toys and treats, Penny used her human-to-cat translator app as a way of getting the cat to look at the camera. The cat, clearly insulted by what the human-to-cat translator app is saying, attacks Penny with its paw . Penny said: ‘It worked, but it also got an unusual reaction from Flam, who proceeded to walk up slowly and pop me in the head. We laughed so hard.’ She added: ‘Who knows what the app was really saying in cat voice, but he sure didn't like it.’ The Cat Shoppe is Nashville’s first feline-friendly shop that sells a number of cat-related products and also runs a non-profit cat rescue centre.

A former soldier who battered a seven-month-old baby so badly that its eyes rolled to the back of its head has been jailed. Paul Davies, 28, left the infant with life-changing injuries and then falsely claimed to the child's mother that it had suffered a seizure. The woman said she had trusted Davies to look after the seven-month-old and when she returned he claimed the baby had 'gone rigid' after having some milk and vomiting. Prosecuting, Tara Wolfe said: 'He said he started to become panicky. He said he tried to call 999 but his phone wasn't working.' The baby was 'pale and stiff' when paramedics arrived and rushed it to hospital where scans found bruising around the neck, a brain bleed and bleeding to both retinas.

The victim's mother, who is also not being identified, told the court she had 'trusted' Davis with the baby.

The male badger was found in an outdoor toilet in Beaminster in Dorset and was admitted to RSPCA West Hatch Wildlife Centre in Taunton, Somerset with wounds to its neck and rump. Experts believe the animal is likely to have been injured in a fight over its territory because females usually give birth in February and are ready to mate again straight away - leading to fierce competition between males. A rare albino badger was taken to a rescue centre after being found with deep bite wounds to its neck and rump, believed to have been caused by fighting over territory during the current mating season . RSPCA wildlife centre supervisor Paul Oaten said: 'Albino badgers are fairly rare so to have one admitted to the centre only happens once in a blue moon. 'This poor badger came in to us with territorial bite wounds on his neck and rump, but other than that he is in good condition. 'He has been seen by the vet and had the wounds cleaned up and will be undergoing a course of antibiotics.' Mr Oaten said it was common to see badgers with these type of wounds during the breeding season. The injured animal was rescued as dozens of badgers have been born in Somerset, in time for Spring. Staff at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in Somerset are caring for three badger cubs which need feeding around the clock. The first cub, named Little Star, has grown from 80g to over a kilogram since being rescued and cared for by the centre. Three rescued badger cubs are being cared for at Secret World Wildlife Rescue in Somerset . The animal was brought in from the cold into a house in Derbyshire by a Jack Russell, who carried it in its jaws. She has been joined by another eight-week old badger cub called Vogue.

The 25-year-old, who was heading to Florida for a family holiday, said: ‘All of a sudden we saw the reflections of the flashing lights of the emergency vehicles and an announcement was made that we would be delayed. As a precaution Southwest Airlines decided to ground the plane and bring in a replacement aircraft . ‘I unfortunately don't know the details of how it happened, but it looks as though the rear of the truck was what hit the engine. ‘As far as I know, no one was injured.

After new England and Wales Cricket Board chairman Colin Graves hinted last weekend there is still a possibility of a return to international cricket for the record-breaking batsman, sacked last year, the first definite attempt by a county to secure his services surfaced on Friday. Leicestershire chief executive Wasim Khan told Cricinfo he had been in touch with Pietersen's advisers about the possibility of signing the 34-year-old between his existing commitments at the Indian and Caribbean premier leagues. Kevin Pietersen played for Surrey in last year's Natwest Twenty20 Blast . Pietersen's agent confirmed an initial discussion did take place, but added it was 'some time ago'. Leicestershire's gambit therefore appears to pre-date Graves' remarks, in which he indicated Pietersen's return to county cricket - as a pre-requisite of being considered again for England - would need to encompass all formats, rather than just Twenty20. Wasim told Cricinfo: 'I approached his agent about his T20 availability. 'But he said it was unlikely he would play any T20 (in England) due to his full CPL commitments.' The former England batsman pictured watching QPR's 2-1 defeat by Arsenal on Wednesday night . Pietersen's agent said: 'I haven't had a conversation with Kevin about Leicestershire - it is not something we have discussed.' Pietersen, who was axed by the ECB 13 months ago after England's 2013/14 Ashes whitewash defeat and described by his employers' managing director Paul Downton as 'disengaged', has since published an autobiography in which he is very critical of several former team-mates and management staff.

A suburban Chicago woman was arrested after police say she grabbed a rifle and shot at her flat-screen television because she was mad her children were watching too much TV. Jennifer Ullery, a mother of three from Algonquin, pleaded not guilty Monday to charges of aggravated reckless discharge of a firearm, possession of a firearm without a firearm owner ID card and three counts of child endangerment in connection to the incident that took place back in January.

The security forces, backed by Shia militias, raised the Iraqi flag over the governorate and the main hospital buildings in the city Monday night, a security official with the forces in Tikrit told CNN. The gains, according to the official, came after a slow advance into the city as the forces dealt with more than 300 improvised explosive devices planted in the city's streets. At least 26 militants were killed in the operation, the official said. Earlier Monday, Iraqi federal police said in a statement aired on Iraqi television that the forces had liberated four neighborhoods in southern Tikrit. The renewed push into Tikrit comes days after a series of U.S.-led airstrikes aimed at ISIS targets around the city. The goal of those airstrikes was to pave the way for Iraqi forces to go in. Now security forces and fighters from Hashd Al-Shaabi, a predominantly Shia paramilitary force that has doing much of the fighting in the critical battle to take Tikrit back from ISIS, say they're gaining ground. Iraqi forces have tried multiple times to win back Tikrit since ISIS, which calls itself the Islamic State, conquered the city in June as part of its campaign to amass an expansive Islamic caliphate. And each time, so far, they've failed. The latest push began after Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi on March 1 ordered Iraqi forces to retake Tikrit and Salahuddin province. Militants have been under pressure ever since in the battleground city, which is the birthplace of former Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein and  located about 160 kilometers (100 miles) north of Baghdad. ISIS responded by adjusting its positions in and around the city, hiding in buildings and other key infrastructure, said Saad al-Hadithi, a spokesman for al-Abadi. This movement led Iraq's military to pause its operation, out of growing worries that a full-on invasion could produce heavy Iraqi military and some civilian casualties. The situation spurred the Iraqi Prime Minister to request help from the U.S.-led coalition, which conducted airstrikes around Tikrit last week. CNN's Jomana Karadsheh, Catherine E. Shoichet,  Ashley Fantz, Ben Wedeman and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.", "completion": "response:\n\nA push to retake Tikrit stalled as ISIS repositioned its forces around the city .\nSpokesman: Iraq's leader requested help because coalition has \"advanced\" capabilities .\nLeaders of predominantly Shiite militia fighting in area had resisted such intervention ."}

The owner of Chelsea Football Club and his family should be hit by new Western sanctions aimed at hurting the strongman's regime and those who propped it up, claimed Alexei Navalny. He called for the same curbs on leading Arsenal FC shareholder, Alisher Usmanov, in a bid to force the Kremlin's hand over Ukraine. Britain should ban major Russian tycoons like Roman Abramovich from London, demanded Vladimir Putin's most prominent foe, Alexei Navalny (pictured) These Russian moneymen are seen as close to strongman Putin, but sanctions so far have not hit them directly. Navalny, released from a short jail sentence in Moscow this week, is seeking to inspire the Russian opposition after the brutal murder of fellow Putin foe Boris Nemtsov in the shadow of the Kremlin. 'You can draw up a blacklist of about 1,000 people who will no longer be allowed entry into Western countries, and you can do it quietly, without any big announcement,' the anti-corruption blogger and lawyer told The Financial Times. Navalny believes that if tycoons such as Abramovich (pictured) can't get to their London residences, it will put pressure on Moscow to pull out of Ukraine . 'Usmanov, Abramovich, and their families - if they can't get to their residences in London or in Switzerland, that will make a difference.' It was essential to hit the wealthy clans who help Putin control Russia, he said. To weaken Putin's resolve over Ukraine, he warned the West: 'You have to hit the propagandists of war, the ones who finance the war.' This was the only way to stop him, he said. Russian oligarchs 'all hate him but they feel they can't but remain silent'. 'A few years ago, we thought this was just nepotism, but now we realise that this is long-term planning: he is installing dynastic rule,' he said. Some wealthy tycoons untouched by sanctions backed Putin to the hilt yet flew to the West to enjoy weekends. He said of the slain Nemtsov that he was a 'communicator' who was 'not afraid'. Navalny added: 'He could bring together everyone in the opposition from liberals to the far left, but he would also talk to people inside the system, like the Communists, who did not accept his views but were open to dialogue with him.' With Nemtsov now dead, Navalny is seen as Russia's most effective and charismatic opposition campaigner.", "completion": "response:\n\nAlexei Navalny says if tycoons can't get to London, it will pressure Moscow .\nSeveral influential Russian tycoons have bases in the British capital .\nNavalny is seen as Russia's most effective  opposition campaigner .\nHe is seeking to inspire the Russian opposition after murder of Nemtsov ."}

The work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers, the musical sea organ (morske orgulje) was created in 2005 and is the first of its kind in the world. Carved into the white stone, the aerophone is 70 meters long and contains a total of 35 organ pipes built under the concrete. The movement of the sea pushes air through each of the individual organ pipes via a plastic tube submerged in the water. And depending on the size and power of the wave, unique musical chords are played through each of the whistle openings on the quayside above. As the sea forces are unpredictable in terms of tidal power, the organ provides a never-ending composition that features numerous musical variations. The sea organ itself was built as part of a music project that looked to repair Zadar, which had suffered much damage during the Second World War. The musical sea organ is the work of architect Nikola Basic and expert Dalmatian stone carvers .

The tiny Ili Pika, an eight-inch long rabbit-relative, is one of the world's most endangered animals with less than 1,000 animals believed to be left in its natural habitat. The Ili Pika population is believed to have declined by almost 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983, scientists say. Adorable: The Ili Pika is one of the world's rarest mammals, and has been spotted for the first time in 20 years in its natural territory in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China . The Ili Pika, formally known as Ochotona iliensis, was discovered by conservationist Li Weidong in 1983, who named it after his hometown. The animals can only be found in the Tianshan mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China, and its territory is under threat, with the population rapidly declining. When the Ili Pika was first discovered, Mr Li and his team estimated that there were around 2,900 animals living in the Tianshan mountain range. Nearly 20 years later, in 2002, Mr Li conducted a new demographic, which found that the population had dropped to 2,000. Last year's fresh census, which is when the Ili Pika was spotted for the first time in 20 years, concluded that the population is down to less than 1,000 pikas. Rare animal: Chinese scientists believe that there are less than 1,000 Ili Pikas left in the world . Disappearing: Ili Pika population is believed to have declined by 70 per cent since its discovery in 1983 . 'I discovered the species, and I watched as it became endangered,' Mr Li told CNN. 'If it becomes extinct in front of me, I'll feel so guilty.' Very little is known about this rare species, as no successful observations about its ecology, behaviour or reproduction has been carried out. Mr Li believes global warming is the cause of the decline in Ili Pikas as the altitude of permanent snow in the Tianshan mountain range has risen. 'This tiny species could be extinct any time,' Mr Li added. 'They don't exist in the sites where they used to be anymore.' The Ili Pika was discovered by conservationist Li Weidong in 1983, and it was he who photographed the adorable animal for the first time in 20 years last summer .", "completion": "response:\n\nThe tiny Ili Pika lives in a mountain range in the Xinjiang region of northwestern China .\nThe rare animal, which was discovered in 1983, is just eight inches from nose to tail .\nNumber of Ili Pikas is believed to be down 70 per cent since its discovery, to less than 1,000 animals ."}

Neither he nor attorney Daryl Parks would say exactly when the suit would be filed, but they said that they disagreed with the grand jury's and the Justice Department's decisions not to charge Wilson in the shooting. \"They have accepted (Wilson's) self-defense,\" Parks told reporters. \"We do not accept his self-defense.\" The slain teen's parents, Michael Brown Sr. and Lesley McSpadden, were in attendance at the news conference but did not speak on advice of their attorneys, Parks said. \"The last 24 hours have been tough for them,\" he said. Word of the lawsuit comes a day after the Justice Department determined there was not sufficient evidence to charge Wilson in Brown's death but found in a separate investigation that the Ferguson Police Department showed a pattern of racial bias. Brown Sr. and McSpadden released a statement Wednesday saying they were disappointed that Wilson would not face charges, but, they added, the federal report on the police department could provide a silver lining. \"We are encouraged that the DOJ will hold the Ferguson Police Department accountable for the pattern of racial bias and profiling they found in their handling of interactions with people of color,\" the statement said. \"It is our hope that through this action, true change will come not only in Ferguson, but around the country. If that change happens, our son's death will not have been in vain.\" In November, a grand jury cleared Wilson and, in an uncharacteristic move in grand jury proceedings, the prosecutor released all the evidence that was considered. Gray said the civil lawsuit will rely on \"pretty much the same evidence,\" but it will be cast differently. The jury in the civil lawsuit will be asked to make a determination based on a lower burden of proof -- by a preponderance of evidence, rather than beyond a reasonable doubt, Parks said.

Councils across the country are rushing to snap up the new high-tech manhole covers as they try to curb the theft of the old, low-tech versions, according to the People's Daily Online. The seemingly drastic measure was taken after previous anti-theft measures - chaining the manhole covers to street lamps - left officials red-faced, turning for sale in various places around the world. High tech: The new manhole covers are fitted with tracking devices to help authorities find the thieves . Problem: More than 240,000 manholes were stolen in Beijing over a 10 year period, thanks to metal values . The chains also proved unpopular, with many pointing out they could easily be cut, and were dangerous for people walking along the street. One man has even demanded compensation after falling flat on his face, thanks to the chain. It is hoped these new covers, which were developed by a Chinese tech company, will not only put would-be thieves off stealing the items, but also help track those who do give into temptation. The covers, along with drain grills, can fetch high prices on the black market, as the price of scrap metal has spiraled in recent years. It has been estimated that more than 240,000 manhole covers were stolen from Beijing's streets in the 10 years to 2013 alone. Measures: Previous attempts at curbing thefts - like tying the manholes to lamp posts - have not worked . The new covers, designed to have shock absorption and noise reduction features, are made out of a metal with a far lower value, as a further deterrent. A test batch of 100 smart manhole covers will be placed on streets in the city of Hangzhou this month,  and - if it is a success - they will be added throughout the city. But it is not just about the money. Officials have revealed there is a safety concern motivating their purchases as well, as people could trip on an upturned manhole. Tao Xiaomin, of Hangzhou urban management office, explained: 'When a cover is moved and the tilt angle is greater than 15 degrees, the tag will send an alarm signal to us.'", "completion": "response:\n\nNew high-tech covers hope to curb the number of thefts on China's streets .\nMore than 240,000 manhole covers stolen in Beijing over a 10-year period .\nAuthorities previously tried chaining them to lamp posts to prevent thefts .\nBut people derided the idea as 'stupid' because thieves just cut the chains ."}

The girl, who has not been named but lives in Boulder, Colorado, allegedly blended the smoothie earlier this month, spiked it with the caustic liquid, then fed it to her unwitting mother, who drank it. Her throat was burned by the bleach, and she had to be treated in hospital - but wrote the incident off as a mistake until her daughter tried again, according to police. Plot: The pre-teen allegedly blended up a smoothie (file photo right) spiked with bleach in the hope of killing her mother after she took away her iPhone (file photo left) The Boulder County sheriff's department said that on her second attempt the woman poured bleach into a water carafe by her mother's bed. When she smelled bleach again she reportedly confronted the girl - who admitted the attempts on her life were vengeance for having her smartphone taken away. She was later arrested. According to ABC News, she was charged with two counts of attempted first-degree murder on Friday. A police spokesman said: 'On March 6, 2015, deputies of the Boulder County Sheriff’s Office were dispatched to Boulder Community Hospital to investigate an assault. 'Subsequent investigation has developed evidence that a 12-year-old Boulder County girl attempted to kill her mother on two separate occasions. 'On both attempts the girl used bleach. The first attempt on March 2, 2015 left her mother feeling ill after her daughter placed bleach into a breakfast smoothie she made. 'Mom noticed an odor of bleach in the drink and thought her daughter had cleaned the glass prior to making the beverage and did not rinse all the bleach out. 'Later in the week the girl poured bleach into a water carafe her mother kept in the bedroom. On the second occasion Mom noticed the odor of bleach in her water and confronted her daughter.

A woman who died last year aged 92 has been sent a council tax bill – for a penny. Elsie Watson left the paltry debt after moving from Woodley near Stockport into a care home whose staff forwarded the unopened bill to her son Barry Holland. The Stockport Council demand, which would have cost 60 times more to post than the penny debt, even offered Mrs Watson the chance to pay instalments. Barry Holland, 72, of Cheadle Heath, whose wife has paid the bill, has branded the letter 'ludicrous.' Stockport Council has since admitted their error and apologised. Mr Holland said: 'It is ludicrous, I really do think it is horrendous that the council can send out letters for a penny to someone who is 92, even if they didn't know she was dead. 'My mum was fiery, I imagine she would have gone down there, thrown a pound at them and said keep the change. 'These people have no knowledge or feelings. 'Whoever sent this has cost 60 times more than a penny with a stamp. 'The bill even said it could be paid in instalments on the back – how is that possible?' Mr Holland said his wife Sandra paid the bill just to put an end to the matter. The Stockport Council demand said Mrs Watson could pay it in instalments. The council have since admitted their error and apologised . Mrs Watson's son Barry Holland, pictured with wife Sandra, said the letter was 'ludicrous' even if his mother was not deceased .

Di Maria’s form had dropped off before that, true, but not as alarmingly as it has in recent weeks. He wasn’t getting hooked at half-time before this event. Alvaro Negredo suffered a similarly shattering blow that ended his family’s love for their new country. He was not the same player after it happened.

Egan was pronounced dead of a heart attack at NYU Langone Medical Center at 2:20 p.m. \"Thank God he had a peaceful death, passing away right after lunch today,\" Cardinal Timothy Dolan, Egan's successor and current archbishop of New York, said in a statement. Egan was appointed archbishop of New York in 2000 and later cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. Egan retired from the archdiocese in 2009. As the leader of one of the largest Catholic communities in the country, Egan oversaw a growth of more than 200,000 registered parishioners and welcomed Pope Benedict XVI on a visit to New York City in 2008 to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the founding of the Diocese of New York. \"Cardinal Egan spread love and knowledge, and brought comfort to countless New Yorkers and others across the country and the world who sought his guidance and counsel -- especially in the aftermath of 9/11,\" said New York Mayor Bill de Blasio in a statement. Egan served previously as the bishop of Bridgeport, Connecticut, from 1988 to 2000, when the diocese was at the center of a child sex abuse scandal. The Bridgeport diocese in 2001 paid $15 million to 26 plaintiffs to settle sexual abuse claims against eight priests. Egan apologized for his involvement in the scandal in a letter read across the New York archdiocese in 2002, though he later retracted that apology in an interview with Connecticut Magazine 10 years later. \"I should never have said that,\" Egan said. \"I did say 'If we did anything wrong, I'm sorry,' but I don't think we did anything wrong.\" Egan was born in Oak Park, Illinois, in 1932 and was ordained in Rome at the Pontifical North American College in 1957.

The devastating event took place on our planet many millions of years ago, but researchers are only now beginning to discover what happened. In a remote part of Central Australia, the two pieces of asteroid left what geophysicists say is the largest impact zone ever found on Earth, spreading over an area 400 kilometers (250 miles) wide. \"The two asteroids must each have been over 10 kilometers across -- it would have been curtains for many life species on the planet at the time,\" said lead researcher Andrew Glikson of the Australian National University. The team published its research in the journal Tectonophysics this month. The crater caused by the asteroids vanished long ago. But Glikson said the researchers stumbled across scars from the impacts during drilling for geothermal research. Traces are buried more than 2 kilometers inside the Earth's crust, under an area near the borders of South Australia, Queensland and the Northern Territory. \"There are two huge deep domes in the crust, formed by the Earth's crust rebounding after the huge impacts, and bringing up rock from the mantle below,\" Glikson said. The researchers are still trying to figure out just how long ago the shattering event happened. The surrounding rocks are 300 million to 600 million years old, according to the team, but they haven't been able to find the sort of evidence left by other meteorite strikes. A big meteorite strike that is believed to have led to the extinction of many dinosaur species 66 million years ago launched a plume of ash into the air that now shows up as a layer of sediment in rocks. But the researchers say they haven't come across a similar layer in sediments from about 300 million years ago. \"It's a mystery -- we can't find an extinction event that matches these collisions. I have a suspicion the impact could be older than 300 million years,\" Glikson said. The discovery of the huge asteroid impacts could lead to new insights about the Earth's history. \"Large impacts like these may have had a far more significant role in the Earth's evolution than previously thought,\" Glikson said.

Residents began calling 911 after their homes and windows began shaking from the blast at 9.45pm Saturday night. An Afghanistan reservist's bullet that exploded in a suburban neighborhood north of Chicago was a tracer round, which are often marked by a different colored tip from other ammunition (file photo) The reservist and his 23-year-old sister both received 'quite a few superficial wounds,' Lindenhurst police told the Chicago Tribune. They were released from the hospital Sunday morning and rejoined their parents, who treated their own small injuries. Tracer rounds contain a combustible compound that leaves a visible trail of the projectiles path. They can be taken out of their shells and ignited for use as flares, the likely intended outcome of Saturday's incident. 'What he thought would happen didn't,' Lindenhurst commander George Moravec said of the incident, which created a flash explosion. Moravec added that the reservist, who returned from Afghanistan last fall with the tracer, had a 'respected history in the military'.

I know he's a great striker, and that it's always difficult to stop him, but we have to do that if we want to go through.' 'We're confident, but we expect a very difficult game. Paris are going to come here to score goals. It'll be a very complicated game. We're ready, and we hope to win in front of our fans. We'll have to see the tactics the coach puts in place. What is certain is that we cannot sit back and wait. 'We have to defend well, but we mustn't go for the 0-0 because if we concede a goal, Paris will qualify by winning 1-0. We have to play to our strengths by trying to score goals and win the game.' Blues boss Jose Mourinho heads out to training as the club celebrate their 110th anniversary, having been formed in 1905 .

The Magpies are 11th in the Premier League table having escaped with a 1-0 win over relegation threatened Aston Villa on Saturday. Shearer, who scored over 200 goals for Newcastle, believes the St James' Park faithful will consider giving up their season tickets soon because of the lack of investment and hope. Newcastle owner Mike Ashley was among the crowd of spectators at St James' Park on Saturday . 'There is no excitement, no anticipation. It takes its toll, even on the most loyal fans in the country. Fans want to dream their team can be successful, whether that's in a domestic cup competition or in Europe,' Shearer told the Telegraph. 'Newcastle fans at the minute are showing why they are some of the best around, because they can't dream. They've been told the cups aren't a priority, that finishing 10th in the Premier League is more important.'

'Unless the club are going to bring in a load of exciting players in the summer, which is highly unlikely when you look at the way it's been run, then I think people might look at giving up. I can only tell you what my mates are thinking about doing because of the lack of hope at the minute,' added Shearer . 'I'd dearly love us to have a cup run, I'd dearly love us to get to Wembley again, I'd much rather that than just finish in mid-table year after year. 'It's not going to happen because we've played a weakened team in every cup game. They've been playing weakened teams in cup competitions since 2007.'

Graves, who assumes the post in May, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the ‘first thing he’s got to do if he wants to get back is play county cricket’. Pietersen, sacked by England over a year ago, is currently unattached after leaving Surrey, but admitted he was ‘pleasantly surprised’ by Graves’s remarks. Pietersen told Sky Sports: ‘The previous chat was clearly that I had been banned from playing for England, which for me was incredibly sad because I do feel my career was cut short and taken away from me at 33.’ Kevin Pietersen has revealed he 'loves' playing for England and could be set for a return to the set up . Colin Graves has revealed that Pietersen will need to play country cricket if he's to play for England . A county stint would almost certainly mean Pietersen having to sacrifice one or both of his Twenty20 franchise deals in India and West Indies, but he insisted: ‘This is not a deal about money. This is about me playing cricket for England, doing something I love. I will have to go away and see where my future lies. But this is really encouraging.’ Graves was later reported as saying: ‘If he does that and scores a lot of runs they can’t ignore him, I would have thought, but that is up to him. Forget personalities. Selectors pick the best players in form. That is their job.' An ECB spokesman sought to clarify the comment, adding: ‘Nothing has changed — only players who are playing consistent high-quality county cricket and who are seen as a positive influence will be selected for England.’ Pietersen's contract with Surrey expired last year so he could go and play in the Indian Premier League and the Big Bash but it's unclear if he'll return to his former employers. Chairman Richard Thompson told Sportsmail: ‘Our understanding at the end of last summer was that Pietersen had no intention of playing red-ball cricket. If not, he will not play for Surrey.’ The batsman's contract with Surrey ended last year but it's unknown if he'll return his former club .", "completion": "response:\n\nKevin Pietersen admits he'd love to play cricket for England again .\nColin Graves appointment as ECB chairman has opened the door for Pietersen to make a return if he plays county cricket .\nThe batsman would be forced to drop a Twenty20 franchise to play county .\nClick here for all the latest cricket news ."}

It found that we are on a par with the Germans when we measure our satisfaction with life, and much more cheerful than those worst hit by the euro crisis, including Spain, Italy, Portugal and Greece. Scandinavian countries ranked happiest, according to the table compiled by Eurostat, the EU’s statistics arm. The British are happier than the French but more miserable than the Irish, an EU league table of happiness revealed yesterday . It was put out to mark today’s International Day of Happiness established by the UN and was based on answers to the question: ‘Overall, how satisfied are you with your life these days?’ Britons scored 7.3 out of ten – compared to a European average of 7.1 – but the Danes, Finns and Swedes all recorded an average satisfaction level of eight. In Britain, the results of the surveys have shown that married people are happier than cohabitees or single people; that young people and the newly retired are happier than the squeezed middle-aged; and that we worry more about our health than most of the rest of the EU. They have also suggested that better-off people are happier than those who are poor. Ireland scored 7.4 to just pip Britain while the people of economically stagnant France rated seven. The Mediterranean countries came even lower, while Bulgarians were bottom of the table, recording a miserable 4.8. The happiness league follows the introduction by Brussels of life satisfaction surveys which are carried out by national statistics ministries across the continent. Britain has been measuring the happiness of the population since 2010, when David Cameron backed the idea, saying it was as important to know about people’s well-being as to publish economic figures. The British surveys are costing taxpayers £2 million a year. Eurostat said yesterday: ‘Life satisfaction is a multi-dimensional concept, which is very much shaped by various socio-demographic factors which lead to different living situations as well as to different expectations and preferences.’ It said that broadly men and women were equally happy, and health was more important to people than money, work or friends.", "completion": "response:\n\nBritish are happier than the French according to an EU table of happiness .\nScandinavian countries ranked happiest and Brits are on par with Germans .\nThe results were put out to mark today’s International Day of Happiness .\nBritons scored 7.3 out of ten – compared to a European average of 7.1 ."}

The agency has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use in hotel room showers. 'Hotels consume a significant amount of water in the U.S. and around the world,' says a proposal on the EPA's website. The gadget will fit onto hotel shower fixtures and transmit  data back to an accounting system using an app . 'Most hotels do not monitor individual guest water usage and as a result, millions of gallons of potable water are wasted every year by hotel guests.' Which is why they want to create an app to monitor the amount of water hotel guests are using - and, they hope, compel people to shorten their shower time by a minute. The gadget will fit onto existing hotel shower fixtures and transmit water usage data back to a central hotel accounting system using an app, which it is hoped will be doled out in major hotel chains. It will be made up of a flow metre, an embedded system and software, and a resource accounting system, and will allow  hotel guests to monitor their daily water online or using a smartphone app. The EPA has paid researchers $15,000 (around £10,000) to develop a wireless device for monitoring water use . The proposal will be marketed to the hotel industry to reduce costs by promoting water conservation among hotel guests. The current average length of shower is estimated to be 8.2 minutes or 17.2 gallons - but it's unknown how hotels will encourage guests to limit this. A spokesperson for the EPA told The Washington Free Beacon that calling for the device was not intended to enable the monitoring of guests shower time. 'It’s ultimately up to hotels to use technology like the monitors being developed at the University of Tulsa. EPA is encouraging creativity with water conservation efforts,' they said.", "completion": "response:\n\nU.S researchers given £10,000 to develop a device to monitor shower use .\nEnvironmental Protection Agency want to save millions of gallons of water .\nIt hopes hotel guest will reduce their shower times by up to one minute ."}

The prime minister on Sunday called on Labor to support the tough new gun laws, saying it was crucial to cracking down on criminals involved in the illegal firearms trade.

'I say to Bill Shorten and the Labor Party, if you're fair dinkum about protecting our community from gun crime you should support these mandatory minimum sentences for people who traffic in illegal firearms,' he told reporters in Sydney. Labor voted against the measures earlier this year, citing an opposition to mandatory sentences. But Mr Abbott said Labor had supported mandatory minimum sentencing for people smugglers when it was in government, and should back its gun trafficking legislation. 'The Labor Party to its credit has a fair record in this parliament on national security,' he said. There are an estimated 250,000 illegal firearms in Australia . 'I don't believe you can properly separate out this crackdown on illegal trafficking in firearms from our overall national security effort.'

Milner is now expected to use the remainder of the season to gauge how much he is needed at the club. The England midfielder would prefer to remain at Man City but is attracting plenty of interest . Milner runs away in celebration after scoring against Leicester City last month . City face a fight to retain their Premier League title from leaders Chelsea and will head to the Nou Camp next week seeking to overturn a 2-1 Champions League deficit to Barcelona. Regular playing time in his preferred position in central midfield at the business end of the campaign may well persuade him to stay in Manchester. Milner has already made 36 appearances for Pellegrini's side this season and has been in good form. He joined City from Aston Villa for £26m in 2010.", "completion": "response:\n\nMilner's Man City contract expires at the end of the year .\nTalks have taken place about extending his stay at the Etihad Stadium .\nEngland midfielder has attracted interest from Arsenal and Liverpool .\nTalks have also taken place with Milan, Inter and Roma .\nMilner, 29, would prefer to stay at the Premier League champions ."}

Who is James Corden, you might ask? He's a household name in the United Kingdom, best known here for \"Into the Woods\" and \"Doctor Who.\" He's also the brand-new host of the CBS \"Late Late Show,\" replacing Craig Ferguson. His first show promises a fresh take on late night talk shows, especially with avant garde comedian and rapper Reggie Watts leading the house band. So far, Corden already has scored quite a coup for his first show: Tom Hanks will be his first guest. With so many late night shows out there, Corden hopes he can stand out thanks to his time slot. \"I think in the time slot we're in, we have a carte blanche in a way to make a looser show and for it to feel like a more fun environment,\" Corden told The Hollywood Reporter. If Corden's promos are any indication, we're in for something different. 2. 'Pretty Little Liars,' Tuesday, 8 p.m. ET, ABC Family . After five seasons, 120 episodes, 123 texts and nine deaths, fans will find out just who has been tormenting the \"liars\" all this time: The identity of \"A\" will be revealed! At least that's what ABC Family promises for Tuesday night's season finale. 3. 'The Mindy Project,' Tuesday, 9:30 p.m. ET, Fox .

Ibrahimovic is eager to get his hands on the Champions League after failing to win the prestigious competition during his time at the likes of Juventus, Barcelona and AC Milan. PSG face Chelsea at Stamford Bridge on Wednesday in the second leg of their last-16 clash which currently stands at 1-1, and Raiola is hopeful Ibrahimovic can lead his side to Champions League glory. 'I hope he wins the Champions League for his sake, for PSG and for French football,' added Raiola. 'It is a matter of luck too as it is not always the best team who wins. 'Zlatan told me the first-leg game against Chelsea was perfect. It was a perfectly prepared game. There is a lot of respect between Laurent Blanc and Ibra. I can tell he likes Blanc.'

Lethal injection remains the primary method for carrying out executions in the state, Gov. Gary R. Herbert said in a statement. A firing squad would only be used in the event the necessary drugs cannot be obtained. \"Those who voiced opposition to this bill are primarily arguing against capital punishment in general and that decision has already been made in our state,\" said Marty Carpenter, a spokesman for Herbert. \"We regret anyone ever commits the heinous crime of aggravated murder to merit the death penalty and we prefer to use our primary method of lethal injection when such a sentence is issued. However, when a jury makes the decision and a judge signs a death warrant, enforcing that lawful decision is the obligation of the executive branch,\" he said. Utah banned death by firing squad in 2004, though inmates who chose that option before the law changed still ended up being shot to death. The last execution by firing squad was in 2010, and it was also the most recent execution in Utah. A Utah firing squad also executed Gary Gilmore in 1977, the first death by capital punishment after the U.S. Supreme Court reinstated the death penalty the prior year.

The unnamed man, who is in his 60s, was one of thousands of Western men who visit Russia every year to find love. It is not known where or how he met his young wife, but he assumed that she would not be allowed into the EU without a visa. A French pensioner was arrested for trying to smuggle his new Russian bride home in a suitcase -before discovering she was free to travel anywhere in the EU (file picture) Because of these fears, he 'folded' her into a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train as he set off back to Nice, in southern France. At Terespol station, on the border between Poland and Belarus, the woman was found by immigration officials, who immediately arrested the couple. After searching the suitcase, Polish customs spokesman Dariusz Sienicki said: 'The Russian wife of the owner of the bag was inside.' There were initial fears that she might have been kidnapped or abused in some other way, however it became clear that she was fine. Mr Sienicki added: 'She was in good shape and wasn't in need of any medical attention.' Despite this, the arrests were deemed valid because the couple had attempted to avoid border controls, which is a criminal offence. The newly-married couple were on their way back to Nice (pictured), France, when their bizarre ploy was rumbled . The wives of men with EU passports can  travel wherever they like in the EU, so if the woman had simply sat next to her husband there would have been no problem. The Russian bride was said to be in her thirties and extremely supple, making it relatively easy for her to fit inside the suitcase. The couple had risked a three-year jail sentence by attempting to evade border control. Mr Sienicki said: 'This was the first time I've seen someone travel like this. She very well could have been a victim of human trafficking.' The couple were eventually released after questioning and were allowed to carry on with their journey.", "completion": "response:\n\nPensioner assumed his new Russian bride wouldn't be allowed into France .\nFrenchman, in his 60s, thought wife could not travel in the EU without visa .\nHe hid her inside a suitcase and placed her in the luggage rack of a train .\nShe was found by a border guard in Poland and the pair were arrested .\nWives of men with EU passports can travel wherever they like in Europe ."}

MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged. Police and prosecutors have been criticised for arresting journalists on suspicion of a range of offences in the wake of phone-hacking allegations, rather than concentrating on terrorism, violent crime and serious fraud. MPs accused Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders (pictured) of needlessly ruining lives by pursuing reporters over allegations then allowing them to languish on bail without being charged . An ongoing four-year investigation into alleged wrongdoing by reporters had cost £33.5million up to the end of September 2014. Since 2011, 64 journalists have been arrested but only ten convicted, four of them being jailed. One has accepted a caution and seven have been acquitted. No further action was taken against 25 of the other journalists investigated. Mrs Saunders was challenged as she gave evidence to the Commons Home Affairs select committee on police bail, following concerns suspects are being left in limbo. Conservative MP Michael Ellis said: ‘Are you conducting – you, the Crown Prosecution Service – a witch-hunt? An ongoing four-year investigation into alleged wrongdoing by reporters had cost £33.5million up to the end of September 2014 (file picture) ‘It is being suggested by more and more people that a witch-hunt is being conducted against journalists and celebrities. ‘Is it because of the groundswell of attention in this area that you are pursing these cases with insufficient evidence?’ Mrs Saunders said: ‘We are not conducting a witch-hunt against anyone, be it journalists or celebrities. 'We do not make any distinction when we look at cases as to who it is we are looking at. What we look at is the evidence.’ She insisted decisions should not be ‘made in haste’.", "completion": "response:\n\nMPs have accused Alison Saunders of ruining lives by pursuing reporters .\nMany have been arrested and languished on bail without being charged .\nSince 2011, 64 journalists have been arrested but only ten were convicted ."}

'Celebrating Asian linked culture, design and tradition influences, we also looked to create a dragon that could be primarily owned and appreciated locally. 'To achieve this the main influence was drawn from the dragon placed on top of Cardiff City Hall, as has been the case since 1904'. Cardiff's controversial switch to red shirts was introduced in June 2012 after Tan bought the club. He believed that the new colour would improve Cardiff's 'appeal in international markets.' The Welsh side were promoted to the Premier League in April 2013, but lasted just one season and fell to relegation in May the following year.

He first rescued par on the 16th with a 60-foot bunker shot and needed a 32-foot putt to ensure his place in the playoff, which he duly holed.

But his father disarmed him before any fight could take place and called police. Then, at Canterbury Crown Court last week, he was ordered him to stay indoors overnight for the next four weeks.

Lesson learned? Don’t play with knives.’ Judge Heather Norton said the father’s actions last December prevented the incident from escalating. And Phil Rowley, defending, said: ‘His dad should be commended for his behaviour.’ The judge told Saward: ‘What you did was a very stupid act. It was not just stupid; it was also dangerous - not just to others but also to yourself. ‘People who take knives on to the street should realise the consequences could be fatal.
